<p>The aqueous or fossiliferous rocks having now been described, we
have next to examine those which may be called volcanic, in the
most extended sense of that term. In the diagram (Fig. 584) suppose
<i>a, a</i> to represent the crystalline formations, such as the
granitic and metamorphic; <i>b, b</i> the fossiliferous strata; and
<i>c, c</i> the volcanic rocks. These last are sometimes found, as
was explained in the first chapter, breaking through <i>a</i> and
<i>b,</i> sometimes overlying both, and occasionally alternating
with the strata <i>b, b.</i></p>

<p><b>External Form, Structure, and Origin of Volcanic
Mountains.</b>&mdash;The origin of volcanic cones with
crater-shaped summits has been explained in the &ldquo;Principles
of Geology&rdquo; (Chapters 23 to 27), where Vesuvius, Etna,
Santorin, and Barren Island are described. The more ancient
portions of those mountains or islands, formed long before the
times of history, exhibit the same external features and internal
structure which belong to most of the extinct volcanoes of still
higher antiquity; and these last have evidently been due to a
complicated series of operations, varied in kind according to
circumstances; as, for example, whether the accumulation took place
above or below the level of the sea, whether the lava issued from
one or several contiguous vents, and, lastly,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 495">[ 495 ]</a></p>

<p>whether the rocks reduced to fusion in the subterranean regions
happened to have contained more or less silica, potash, soda, lime,
iron, and other ingredients. We are best acquainted with the
effects of eruptions above water, or those called sub&AElig;rial or
supramarine; yet the products even of these are arranged in so many
ways that their interpretation has given rise to a variety of
contradictory opinions, some of which will have to be considered in
this chapter.</p>

</center>

<p><i>Cones and Craters.</i>&mdash;In regions where the eruption of
volcanic matter has taken place in the open air, and where the
surface has never since been subjected to great aqueous denudation,
cones and craters constitute the most striking peculiarity of this
class of formations. Many hundreds of these cones are seen in
central France, in the ancient provinces of Auvergne, Velay, and
Vivarais, where they observe, for the most part, a linear
arrangement, and form chains of hills. Although none of the
eruptions have happened within the historical era, the streams of
lava may still be traced distinctly descending from many of the
craters, and following the lowest levels of the existing valleys.
The origin of the cone and crater-shaped hill is well understood,
the growth of many having been watched during volcanic eruptions. A
chasm or fissure first opens in the earth, from which great volumes
of steam are evolved. The explosions are so violent as to hurl up
into the air fragments of broken stone, parts of which are shivered
into minute atoms. At the same time melted stone or <i>lava</i>
usually ascends through the chimney or vent by which the gases make
their escape. Although extremely heavy, this lava is forced up by
the expansive power of entangled gaseous fluids, chiefly steam or
aqueous vapour, exactly in the same manner as water is made to boil
over the edge of a vessel when steam has been generated at the
bottom by heat. Large quantities of the lava are also shot up into
the air, where it separates into fragments, and acquires a spongy
texture by the sudden enlargement</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 496">[ 496 ]</a></p>

<p>of the included gases, and thus forms <i>scori&aelig;,</i> other
portions being reduced to an impalpable powder or dust. The
showering down of the various ejected materials round the orifice
of eruption gives rise to a conical mound, in which the successive
envelopes of sand and scori&aelig; form layers, dipping on all
sides from a central axis. In the mean time a hollow, called a <i>
crater,</i> has been kept open in the middle of the mound by the
continued passage upward of steam and other gaseous fluids. The
lava sometimes flows over the edge of the crater, and thus thickens
and strengthens the sides of the cone; but sometimes it breaks down
the cone on one side (see Fig. 585), and often it flows out from a
fissure at the base of the hill, or at some distance from its
base.</p>

<p>Some geologists had erroneously supposed, from observations made
on recent cones of eruption, that lava which consolidates on steep
slopes is always of a scoriaceous or vesicular structure, and never
of that compact texture which we find in those rocks which are
usually termed &ldquo;trappean.&rdquo; Misled by this theory, they
have gone so far as to believe that if melted matter has originally
descended a slope at an angle exceeding four or five degrees, it
never, on cooling, acquires a stony compact texture. Consequently,
whenever they found in a volcanic mountain sheets of stony
materials inclined at angles of from 5&deg; to 20&deg; or even more
than 30&deg;, they thought themselves warranted in assuming that
such rocks had been originally horizontal, or very slightly
inclined, and had acquired their high inclination by subsequent
upheaval. To such dome-shaped mountains with a cavity in the
middle, and with the inclined beds having what was called a
qu&acirc;qu&acirc;versal dip or a slope outward on all sides, they
gave the name of &ldquo;Elevation craters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the late Leopold Von Buch, the author of this theory, had
selected the Isle of Palma, one of the Canaries, as a typical
illustration of this form of volcanic mountain, I visited that
island in 1854, in company with my friend Mr. Hartung, and I
satisfied myself that it owes its origin to a series of eruptions
of the same nature as those which formed the minor cones, already
alluded to. In some of the more ancient or Miocene volcanic
mountains, such as Mont Dor and Cantal in central France, the mode
of origin by upheaval as above described is attributed to those
dome-shaped masses, whether they possess or not a great central
cavity, as in Palma. Where this cavity is present, it has probably
been due to one or more great explosions similar to that which
destroyed a great part of ancient Vesuvius in the time of Pliny.
Similar paroxysmal catastrophes have caused in historical times</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 497">[ 497 ]</a></p>

<p>the truncation on a grand scale of some large cones in Java and
elsewhere.*</p>

<p>Among the objections which may be considered as fatal to Von
Buch&rsquo;s doctrine of upheaval in these cases, I may state that
a series of volcanic formations extending over an area six or seven
miles in its shortest diameter, as in Palma, could not be
accumulated in the form of lavas, tuffs, and volcanic breccias or
agglomerates without producing a mountain as lofty as that which
they now constitute. But assuming that they were first horizontal,
and then lifted up by a force acting most powerfully in the centre
and tilting the beds on all sides, a central crater having been
formed by explosion or by a chasm opening in the middle, where the
continuity of the rocks was interrupted, we should have a right to
expect that the chief ravines or valleys would open towards the
central cavity, instead of which the rim of the great crater in
Palma and other similar ancient volcanoes is entire for more than
three parts of the whole circumference.</p>

<p>If dikes are seen in the precipices surrounding such craters or
central cavities, they certainly imply rents which were filled up
with liquid matter. But none of the dislocations producing such
rents can have belonged to the supposed period of terminal and
paroxysmal upheaval, for had a great central crater been already
formed before they originated, or at the time when they took place,
the melted matter, instead of filling the narrow vents, would have
flowed down into the bottom of the cavity, and would have
obliterated it to a certain extent. Making due allowance for the
quantity of matter removed by suba&euml;rial denudation in volcanic
mountains of high antiquity, and for the grand explosions which are
known to have caused truncation in active volcanoes, there is no
reason for calling in the violent hypothesis of elevation craters
to explain the structure of such mountains as Teneriffe, the Grand
Canary, Palma, or those of central France, Etna, or Vesuvius, all
of which I have examined. With regard to Etna, I have shown, from
observations made by me in 1857, that modern lavas, several of them
of known date, have formed continuous beds of compact stone even on
slopes of 15, 36, and 38 degrees, and, in the case of the lava of
1852, more than 40 degrees. The thickness of these tabular layers
varies from 1&frac12; foot to 26 feet. And their planes of
stratification are parallel to those of the overlying and
underlying scori&aelig; which form part of the same
currents.&dagger;</p>

<p><b>Nomenclature of Trappean Rocks.</b>&mdash;When geologists
first began to examine attentively the structure of the
northern</p>

<p class="fnote">* Principles, vol. ii, pp. 56 and 145.<br>
&dagger; Memoir on Mount Etna, Phil. Trans., 1858.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 498">[ 498 ]</a></p>

<p>and western parts of Europe, they were almost entirely ignorant
of the phenomena of existing volcanoes. They found certain rocks,
for the most part without stratification, and of a peculiar mineral
composition, to which they gave different names, such as basalt,
greenstone, porphyry, trap tuff, and amygdaloid. All these, which
were recognised as belonging to one family, were called
&ldquo;trap&rdquo; by Bergmann, from <i>trappa,</i> Swedish for a
flight of steps&mdash;a name since adopted very generally into the
nomenclature of the science; for it was observed that many rocks of
this class occurred in great tabular masses of unequal extent, so
as to form a succession of terraces or steps. It was also felt that
some general term was indispensable, because these rocks, although
very diversified in form and composition, evidently belonged to one
group, distinguishable from the Plutonic as well as from the
non-volcanic fossiliferous rocks.</p>

<p>By degrees familiarity with the products of active volcanoes
convinced geologists more and more that they were identical with
the trappean rocks. In every stream of modern lava there is some
variation in character and composition, and even where no important
difference can be recognised in the proportions of silica, alumina,
lime, potash, iron, and other elementary materials, the resulting
materials are often not the same, for reasons which we are as yet
unable to explain. The difference also of the lavas poured out from
the same mountain at two distinct periods, especially in the
quantity of silica which they contain, is often so great as to give
rise to rocks which are regarded as forming distinct families,
although there may be every intermediate gradation between the two
extremes, and although some rocks, forming a transition from the
one class to the other, may often be so abundant as to demand
special names. These species might be multiplied indefinitely, and
I can only afford space to name a few of the principal ones, about
the composition and aspect of which there is the least discordance
of opinion.</p>

<p><b>Minerals most abundant in Volcanic Rocks.</b>&mdash;The
minerals which form the chief constituents of these igneous rocks
are few in number. Next to quartz, which is nearly pure silica or
silicic acid, the most important are those silicates commonly
classed under the several heads of feldspar, mica, hornblende or
augite, and olivine. In Table 28.1, in drawing up which I have
received the able assistance of Mr. David Forbes, the chemical
analysis of these minerals and their varieties is shown, and he has
added the specific gravity of the different mineral species, the
geological application of which in determining the rocks formed by
these minerals will be explained in the sequel (p.504).</p>

<p class="fnote2">In the &ldquo;Other constituents&rdquo; the
following signs are used: F=Fluorine, Li=Lithia, W=Loss on igniting
the mineral, in most instances only Water.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 500">[ 500 ]</a></p>

<p>From the table above it will be observed that many minerals are
omitted which, even if they are of common occurrence, are more to
be regarded as accessory than as essential components of the rocks
in which they are found.* Such are, for example, Garnet, Epidote,
Tourmaline, Idocrase, Andalusite, Scapolite, the various Zeolites,
and several other silicates of somewhat rarer occurrence.
Magnetite, Titanoferrite, and Iron-pyrites also occur as normal
constituents of various igneous rocks, although in very small
amount, as also Apatite, or phosphate of lime. The other salts of
lime, including its carbonate or calcite, although often met with,
are invariably products of secondary chemical action.</p>

<p>The Zeolites, above mentioned, so named from the manner in which
they froth up under the blow-pipe and melt into a glass, differ in
their chemical composition from all the other mineral constituents
of volcanic rocks, since they are hydrated silicates containing
from 10 to 25 per cent of water. They abound in some trappean rocks
and ancient lavas, where they fill up vesicular cavities and
interstices in the substance of the rocks, but are rarely found in
any quantity in recent lavas; in most cases they are to be regarded
as secondary products formed by the action of water on the other
constituents of the rocks. Among them the species Analcime,
Stilbite, Natrolite, and Chabazite may be mentioned as of most
common occurrence.</p>

<p><b>Quartz Group.</b>&mdash;The microscope has shown that pure
quartz is oftener present in lavas than was formerly supposed. It
had been argued that the quartz in granite having a specific
gravity of 2&middot;6, was not of purely igneous origin, because
the silica resulting from fusion in the laboratory has only a
specific gravity of 2&middot;3. But Mr. David Forbes has
ascertained that the free quartz in trachytes, which are known to
have flowed as lava, has the same specific gravity as the ordinary
quartz of granite; and the recent researches of Von Rath and others
prove that the mineral Tridymite, which is crystallised silica of
specific gravity 2&middot;3 (see Table, p. 499), is of common
occurrence in the volcanic rocks of Mexico, Auvergne, the Rhine,
and elsewhere, although hitherto entirely overlooked.</p>

<p><b>Feldspar Group.</b>&mdash;In the Feldspar group (Table, p.
499) the five mineral species most commonly met with as rock
constituents are: 1. Orthoclase, often called common or
potash-feldspar. 2. Albite, or soda-feldspar, a mineral which plays
a more subordinate part than was formerly supposed, this name
having been given to much which has since been proved to be
Oligoclase. 3. Oligoclase, or soda-lime feldspar,</p>

<p class="fnote">* For analyses of these minerals see the
Mineralogies of Dana and Bristow.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 501">[ 501 ]</a></p>

<p>in which soda is present in much larger proportion than lime,
and of which mineral andesite are andesine, is considered to be a
variety. 4. Labradorite, or lime-soda-feldspar, in which the
proportions of lime and soda are the reverse to what they are in
Oligoclase. 5. Anorthite or lime-feldspar. The two latter feldspars
are rarely if ever found to enter into the composition of rocks
containing quartz.</p>

<p>In employing such terms as potash-feldspar, etc., it must,
however, always be borne in mind that it is only intended to direct
attention to the predominant alkali or alkaline earth in the
mineral, not to assert the absence of the others, which in most
cases will be found to be present in minor quantity. Thus
potash-feldspar (orthoclase) almost always contains a little soda,
and often traces of lime or magnesia; and in like manner with the
others. The terms &ldquo;glassy&rdquo; and &ldquo;compact&rdquo;
feldspars only refer to structure, and not to species or
composition; the student should be prepared to meet with any of the
above feldspars in either of these conditions: the glassy state
being apparently due to quick cooling, and the compact to
conditions unfavourable to crystallisation; the so-called
&ldquo;compact feldspar&rdquo; is also very commonly found to be an
admixture of more than one feldspar species, and frequently also
contains quartz and other extraneous mineral matter only to be
detected by the microscope.</p>

<p>Feldspars when arranged according to their system of
crystallisation are <i>monoclinic,</i> having one axis obliquely
inclined; or <i>triclinic,</i> having the three axes all obliquely
inclined to each other. If arranged with reference to their
cleavage they are <i>orthoclastic,</i> the fracture taking place
always at a right angle; or <i>plagioclastic,</i> in which the
cleavages are oblique to one another. Orthoclase is orthoclastic
and monoclinic; all the other feldspars are plagioclastic and
triclinic.</p>

<p><i>Minerals in Meteorites.</i>&mdash;That variety of the
Feldspar Group which is called Anorthite has been shown by
Rammelsberg to occur in a meteoric stone, and his analysis proves
it to be almost identical in its chemical proportions to the same
mineral in the lavas of modern volcanoes. So also Bronzite
(Enstatite) and Olivine have been met with in meteorites shown by
analysis to come remarkably near to these minerals in ordinary
rocks.</p>

<p><b>Mica Group.</b>&mdash;With regard to the micas, the four
principal species (Table, p. 499) all contain potash in nearly the
same proportion, but differ greatly in the proportion and nature of
their other ingredients. Muscovite is often called common or potash
mica; Lepidolite is characterised by containing lithia in addition;
Biotite contains a large amount of</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 502">[ 502 ]</a></p>

<p>magnesia and oxide of iron; whilst Phlogopite contains still
more of the former substance. In rocks containing quartz, muscovite
or lepidolite are most common. The mica in recent volcanic rocks,
gabbros, and diorites is usually Biotite, while that so common in
metamorphic limestones is usually, if not always, Phlogopite.</p>

<p><b>Amphibole and Pyroxene Group.</b>&mdash;The minerals included
in the table under the Amphibole and Pyroxene Group differ somewhat
in their crystallisation form, though they all belong to the
monoclinic system. Amphibole is a general name for all the
different varieties of Hornblende, Actinolite, Tremolite, etc.,
while Pyroxene includes Augite, Diallage, Malacolite, Sahlite, etc.
The two divisions are so much allied in chemical composition and
crystallographic characters, and blend so completely one into the
other in Uralite (see <a href="#page 499">page 499</a>), that it is
perhaps best to unite them in one group.</p>

<p><b>Theory of Isomorphism.</b>&mdash;The history of the changes
of opinion on this point is curious and instructive. Werner first
distinguished augite from hornblende; and his proposal to separate
them obtained afterwards the sanction of Ha&uuml;y, Mohs, and other
celebrated mineralogists. It was agreed that the form of the
crystals of the two species was different, and also their
structure, as shown by <i>cleavage</i>&mdash;that is to say, by breaking
or cleaving the mineral with a chisel, or a blow of the hammer, in
the direction in which it yields most readily. It was also found by
analysis that augite usually contained more lime, less alumina, and
no fluoric acid; which last, though not always found in hornblende,
often enters into its composition in minute quantity. In addition
to these characters, it was remarked as a geological fact, that
augite and hornblende are very rarely associated together in the
same rock. It was also remarked that in the crystalline slags of
furnaces augitic forms were frequent, the hornblendic entirely
absent; hence it was conjectured that hornblende might be the
result of slow, and augite of rapid cooling. This view was
confirmed by the fact that Mitscherlich and Berthier were able to
make augite artificially, but could never succeed in forming
hornblende. Lastly, Gustavus Rose fused a mass of hornblende in a
porcelain furnace, and found that it did not, on cooling, assume
its previous shape, but invariably took that of augite. The same
mineralogist observed certain crystals called Uralite (see Table,
<a href="#page 499">p. 499</a>) in rocks from Siberia, which
possessed the cleavage and chemical composition of hornblende,
while they had the external form of augite.</p>

<p>If, from these data, it is inferred that the same substance</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 503">[ 503 ]</a></p>

<p>may assume the crystalline forms of hornblende or augite
indifferently, according to the more or less rapid cooling of the
melted mass, it is nevertheless certain that the variety commonly
called augite, and recognised by a peculiar crystalline form, has
usually more lime in it, and less alumina, than that called
hornblende, although the quantities of these elements do not seem
to be always the same. Unquestionably the facts and experiments
above mentioned show the very near affinity of hornblende and
augite; but even the convertibility of one into the other, by
melting and recrystallising, does not perhaps demonstrate their
absolute identity. For there is often some portion of the materials
in a crystal which are not in perfect chemical combination with the
rest. Carbonate of lime, for example, sometimes carries with it a
considerable quantity of silex into its own form of crystal, the
silex being mechanically mixed as sand, and yet not preventing the
carbonate of lime from assuming the form proper to it. This is an
extreme case, but in many others some one or more of the
ingredients in a crystal may be excluded from perfect chemical
union; and after fusion, when the mass recrystallises, the same
elements may combine perfectly or in new proportions, and thus a
new mineral may be produced. Or some one of the gaseous elements of
the atmosphere, the oxygen for example, may, when the melted matter
reconsolidates, combine with some one of the component
elements.</p>

<p>The different quantity of the impurities or the refuse above
alluded to, which may occur in all but the most transparent and
perfect crystals, may partly explain the discordant results at
which experienced chemists have arrived in their analysis of the
same mineral. For the reader will often find that crystals of a
mineral determined to be the same by physical characters,
crystalline form, and optical properties, have been declared by
skilful analysers to be composed of distinct elements. This
disagreement seemed at first subversive of the atomic theory, or
the doctrine that there is a fixed and constant relation between
the crystalline form and structure of a mineral and its chemical
composition. The apparent anomaly, however, which threatened to
throw the whole science of mineralogy into confusion, was
reconciled to fixed principles by the discoveries of Professor
Mitscherlich at Berlin, who ascertained that the composition of the
minerals which had appeared so variable was governed by a general
law, to which he gave the name of <i>isomorphism</i> (from <i>
isos,</i> equal, and <i>morphe,</i> form). According to this law,
the ingredients of a given species of mineral are not</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 504">[ 504 ]</a></p>

<p>absolutely fixed as to their kind and quality; but one
ingredient may be replaced by an equivalent portion of some
analogous ingredient. Thus, in augite, the lime may be in part
replaced by portions of protoxide of iron, or of manganese, while
the form of the crystal, and the angle of its cleavage planes,
remain the same. These vicarious substitutions, however, of
particular elements can not exceed certain defined limits.</p>

<p><b>Basaltic Rocks.</b>&mdash;The two principal families of
trappean or volcanic rocks are the basalts and the trachytes, which
differ chiefly from each other in the quantity of silica which they
contain. The basaltic rocks are comparatively poor in silica,
containing less than 50 per cent of that mineral, and none in a
pure state or as free quartz, apart from the rest of the matrix.
They contain a larger proportion of lime and magnesia than the
trachytes, so that they are heavier, independently of the frequent
presence of the oxides of iron which in some cases forms more than
a fourth part of the whole mass. Abich has, therefore, proposed
that we should weigh these rocks, in order to appreciate their
composition in cases where it is impossible to separate their
component minerals. Thus, basalt from Staffa, containing
47&middot;80 per cent of silica, has a specific gravity of
2&middot;95; whereas trachyte, which has 66 per cent of silica, has
a specific gravity of only 2&middot;68; trachytic porphyry,
containing 69 per cent of silica, a specific gravity of only
2&middot;58. If we then take a rock of intermediate composition,
such as that prevailing in the Peak of Teneriffe, which Abich calls
Trachyte-dolerite, its proportion of silica being intermediate, or
58 per cent, it weighs 2&middot;78, or more than trachyte, and less
than basalt.*</p>

<p><i>Basalt.</i>&mdash;The different varieties of this rock are
distinguished by the names of basalts, anamezites, and dolerites,
names which, however, only denote differences in texture without
implying any difference in mineral or chemical composition: the
term <i>Basalt</i> being used only when the rock is compact,
amorphous, and often semi-vitreous in texture, and when it breaks
with a perfect conchoidal fracture; when, however, it is uniformly
crystalline in appearance, yet very close-grained, the name <i>
Anamesite</i> (from <i>anamesos,</i> intermediate) is employed, but
if the rock be so coarsely crystallised that its different mineral
constituents can be easily recognised by the eye, it is called <i>
Dolerite</i> (from <i>doleros,</i> deceitful), in allusion to the
difficulty of distinguishing it from some of the rocks known as
Plutonic.</p>

<p>appearance from basalt, for although rarely so heavy,
dark-coloured, or compact, it may present at times all these
varieties of texture. Both these rocks are composed of triclinic
feldspar and augite with more or less olivine, magnetic or
titaniferous oxide of iron, and usually a little nepheline,
leucite, and apatite; basalt usually contains considerably more
olivine than melaphyre, but chemically they are closely allied,
although the melaphyres usually contain more silica and alumina,
with less oxides of iron, lime, and magnesia, than the basalts. The
Rowley Hills in Staffordshire, commonly known as Rowley Ragstone,
are melaphyre.</p>

<p><i>Greenstone.</i>&mdash;This name has usually been extended to
all granular mixtures, whether of hornblende and feldspar, or of
augite and feldspar. The term <i>diorite</i> has been applied
exclusively to compounds of hornblende and triclinic feldspar. <i>
Labrador-rock</i> is a term used for a compound of labradorite or
labrador-feldspar and hypersthene; when the hypersthene
predominates it is sometimes known under the name of <i>
Hypersthene-rock.</i> <i>Gabbro</i> and <i>Diabase</i> are rocks
mainly composed of triclinic feldspars and diallage. All these
rocks become sometimes very crystalline, and help to connect the
volcanic with the Plutonic formations, which will be treated of in
Chapter XXXI.</p>

<p><b>Trachytic Rocks.</b>&mdash;The name trachyte (from <i>
trachus,</i> rough) was originally given to a coarse granular
feldspathic rock which was rough and gritty to the touch. The term
was subsequently made to include other rocks, such as clinkstone
and obsidian, which have the same mineral composition, but to
which, owing to their different texture, the word in its original
meaning would not apply. The feldspars which occur in Trachytic
rocks are invariably those which contain the largest proportion of
silica, or from 60 to 70 per cent of that mineral. Through the base
are usually disseminated crystals of glassy feldspar, mica, and
sometimes hornblende. Although quartz is not a necessary ingredient
in the composition of this rock, it is very frequently present, and
the quartz trachytes are very largely developed in many volcanic
districts. In this respect the trachytes differ entirely from the
members of the Basaltic family, and are more nearly allied to the
granites.</p>

<p><i>Obsidian.</i>&mdash;Obsidian, Pitchstone, and Pearlstone are
only different forms of a volcanic glass produced by the fusion of
trachytic rocks. The distinction between them is caused by
different rates of cooling from the melted state, as has been
proved by experiment. Obsidian is of a black or ash-grey colour,
and though opaque in mass is transparent in thin edges.</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 506">[ 506 ]</a></p>

<p><i>Clinkstone or Phonolite.</i>&mdash;Among the rocks of the
trachytic family, or those in which the feldspars are rich in
silica, that termed Clinkstone or Phonolite is conspicuous by its
fissile structure, and its tendency to lamination, which is such as
sometimes to render it useful as roofing-slate. It rings when
struck with the hammer, whence its name; is compact, and usually of
a greyish blue or brownish colour; is variable in composition, but
almost entirely composed of feldspar. When it contains disseminated
crystals of feldspar, it is called <i>Clinkstone porphyry.</i></p>

<p><b>Volcanic Rocks distinguished by special Forms of
Structure.</b>&mdash;Many volcanic rocks are commonly spoken of
under names denoting structure alone, which must not be taken to
imply that they are distinct rocks, i.e., that they differ from one
another either in mineral or chemical composition. Thus the terms
Trachytic porphyry, Trachytic tuff, etc., merely refer to the same
rock under different conditions of mechanical aggregation or
crystalline development which would be more correctly expressed by
the use of the adjective, as porphyritic trachyte, etc., but as
these terms are so commonly employed it is considered advisable to
direct the student&rsquo;s attention to them.</p>

<img src="images4/fig586.jpg" width="179" height="232" alt=
"Fig. 586: Porphyry. White crystals of feldspar in a dark base of hornblende and feldspar."
 align="left"> 

<p><i>Porphyry</i> is one of this class, and very characteristic of
the volcanic formations. When distinct crystals of one or more
minerals are scattered through an earthy or compact base, the rock
is termed a porphyry (see Fig. 586). Thus trachyte is usually
porphyritic; for in it, as in many modern lavas, there are crystals
of feldspar; but in some porphyries the crystals are of augite,
olivine, or other minerals. If the base be greenstone, basalt, or
pitchstone, the rock may be denominated greenstone-porphyry,
pitchstone-porphyry, and so forth. The old classical type of this
form of rock is the red porphyry of Egypt, or the well-known
&ldquo;Rosso antico.&rdquo; It consists, according to Delesse, of a
red feldspathic base in which are disseminated rose-coloured
crystals of the feldspar called oligoclase, with some plates of
blackish hornblende and grains of oxide of iron (iron-glance). <i>
Red quartziferous porphyry</i> is a much more siliceous rock,
containing about 70 or 80 per cent of silex, while that of Egypt
has only 62 per cent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 507">[ 507 ]</a></p>

<p><i>Amygdaloid.</i>&mdash;This is also another form of igneous
rock, admitting of every variety of composition. It comprehends any
rock in which round or almond-shaped nodules of some mineral, such
as agate, chalcedony, calcareous spar, or zeolite, are scattered
through a base of wacke, basalt, greenstone, or other kind of trap.
It derives its name from the Greek word <i>amygdalon,</i> an
almond. The origin of this structure can not be doubted, for we may
trace the process of its formation in modern lavas. Small pores or
cells are caused by bubbles of steam and gas confined in the melted
matter. After or during consolidation, these empty spaces are
gradually filled up by matter separating from the mass, or
infiltered by water permeating the rock. As these bubbles have been
sometimes lengthened by the flow of the lava before it finally
cooled, the contents of such cavities have the form of almonds. In
some of the amygdaloidal traps of Scotland, where the nodules have
decomposed, the empty cells are seen to have a glazed or vitreous
coating, and in this respect exactly resemble scoriaceous lavas, or
the slags of furnaces.</p>

<img src="images4/fig587.jpg" width="206" height="259" alt=
"Fig. 587: Scoriaceous lava in part converted into an amygdaloid."
align="right"> 

<p>Fig. 587 represents a fragment of stone taken from the upper
part of a sheet of basaltic lava in Auvergne. One-half is
scoriaceous, the pores being perfectly empty; the other part is
amygdaloidal, the pores or cells being mostly filled up with
carbonate of lime, forming white kernels.</p>

<p><i>Lava.</i>&mdash;This term has a somewhat vague signification,
having been applied to all melted matter observed to flow in
streams from volcanic vents. When this matter consolidates in the
open air, the upper part is usually scoriaceous, and the mass
becomes more and more stony as we descend, or in proportion as it
has consolidated more slowly and under greater pressure. At the
bottom, however, of a stream of lava, a small portion of
scoriaceous rock very frequently occurs, formed by the first thin
sheet of liquid matter, which often precedes the main current, and
solidifies under slight pressure.</p>

<p>The more compact lavas are often porphyritic, but even the
scoriaceous part sometimes contains imperfect crystals, which have
been derived from some older rocks, in which</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 508">[ 508 ]</a></p>

<p>the crystals pre-existed, but were not melted, as being more
infusible in their nature. Although melted matter rising in a
crater, and even that which enters a rent on the side of a crater,
is called lava, yet this term belongs more properly to that which
has flowed either in the open air or on the bed of a lake or sea.
If the same fluid has not reached the surface, but has been merely
injected into fissures below ground, it is called trap. There is
every variety of composition in lavas; some are trachytic, as in
the Peak of Teneriffe; a great number are basaltic, as in Vesuvius
and Auvergne; others are andesitic, as those of Chili; some of the
most modern in Vesuvius consist of green augite, and many of those
of Etna of augite and labrador-feldspar.*</p>

<p><i>Scori&aelig;</i> and <i>Pumice</i> may next be mentioned, as
porous rocks produced by the action of gases on materials melted by
volcanic heat. <i>Scori&aelig;</i> are usually of a reddish-brown
and black colour, and are the cinders and slags of basaltic or
augitic lavas. <i>Pumice</i> is a light, spongy, fibrous substance,
produced by the action of gases on trachytic and other lavas; the
relation, however, of its origin to the composition of lava is not
yet well understood. Von Buch says that it never occurs where only
labrador-feldspar is present.</p>

<p><i>Volcanic Ash or Tuff, Trap Tuff.</i>&mdash;Small angular
fragments of the scori&aelig; and pumice, above-mentioned, and the
dust of the same, produced by volcanic explosions, form the tuffs
which abound in all regions of active volcanoes, where showers of
these materials, together with small pieces of other rocks ejected
from the crater, and more or less burnt, fall down upon the land or
into the sea. Here they often become mingled with shells, and are
stratified. Such tuffs are sometimes bound together by a calcareous
cement, and form a stone susceptible of a beautiful polish. But
even when little or no lime is present, there is a great tendency
in the materials of ordinary tuffs to cohere together. The term <i>
volcanic ash</i> has been much used for rocks of all ages supposed
to have been derived from matter ejected in a melted state from
volcanic orifices. We meet occasionally with extremely compact beds
of volcanic materials, interstratified with fossiliferous rocks.
These may sometimes be tuffs, although their density or compactness
is such as the cause them to resemble many of those kinds of trap
which are found in ordinary dikes.</p>

<p><i>Wacke</i> is a name given to a decomposed state of various
trap rocks of the basaltic family, or those which are poor in
silica. It resembles clay of a yellowish or brown colour, and</p>

<p class="fnote">* G. Hose, Ann. des Mines, tome viii, p. 32.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 509">[ 509 ]</a></p>

<p>passes gradually from the soft state to the hard dolerite,
greenstone, or other trap rock from which it has been derived.</p>

<p><i>Agglomerate.</i>&mdash;In the neighbourhood of volcanic
vents, we frequently observe accumulations of angular fragments of
rocks formed during eruptions by the explosive action of steam,
which shatters the subjacent stony formations, and hurls them up
into the air. They then fall in showers around the cone or crater,
or may be spread for some distance over the surrounding country.
The fragments consist usually of different varieties of scoriaceous
and compact lavas; but other kinds of rock, such as granite or even
fossiliferous limestones, may be intermixed; in short, any
substance through which the expansive gases have forced their way.
The dispersion of such materials may be aided by the wind, as it
varies in direction or intensity, and by the slope of the cone down
which they roll, or by floods of rain, which often accompany
eruptions. But if the power of running water, or of the waves and
currents of the sea, be sufficient to carry the fragments to a
distance, it can scarcely fail to wear off their angles, and the
formation then becomes a <i>conglomerate.</i> If occasionally
globular pieces of scori&aelig; abound in an agglomerate, they may
not owe their round form to attrition. When all the angular
fragments are of volcanic rocks the mass is usually termed a
volcanic breccia.</p>

<p><i>Laterite</i> is a red or brick-like rock composed of silicate
of alumina and oxide of iron. The red layers called &ldquo;ochre
beds,&rdquo; dividing the lavas of the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, are
laterites. These were found by Delesse to be trap impregnated with
the red oxide of iron, and in part reduced to kaolin. When still
more decomposed, they were found to be clay coloured by red ochre.
As two of the lavas of the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway are parted by a
bed of lignite, it is not improbable that the layers of laterite
seen in the Antrim cliffs resulted from atmospheric decomposition.
In Madeira and the Canary Islands streams of lava of suba&euml;rial
origin are often divided by red bands of laterite, probably ancient
soils formed by the decomposition of the surfaces of lava-currents,
many of these soils having been coloured red in the atmosphere by
oxide of iron, others burnt into a red brick by the overflowing of
heated lavas. These red bands are sometimes prismatic, the small
prisms being at right angles to the sheets of lava. Red clay or red
marl, formed as above stated by the disintegration of lava,
scori&aelig;, or tuff, has often accumulated to a great thickness
in the valleys of Madeira, being washed into them by alluvial
action; and some of the thick beds of</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 510">[ 510 ]</a></p>

<p>laterite in India may have had a similar origin. In India,
however, especially in the Deccan, the term &ldquo;laterite&rdquo;
seems to have been used too vaguely to answer the above definition.
The vegetable soil in the gardens of the suburbs of Catania which
was overflowed by the lava of 1669 was turned or burnt into a layer
of red brick-coloured stone, or in other words, into laterite,
which may now be seen supporting the old lava-current.</p>

<p><b>Columnar and Globular Structure.</b>&mdash;One of the
characteristic forms of volcanic rocks, especially of basalt, is
the columnar, where large masses are divided into regular prisms,
sometimes easily separable, but in other cases adhering firmly
together. The columns vary, in the number of angles, from three to
twelve; but they have most commonly from five to seven sides. They
are often divided transversely, at nearly equal distances, like the
joints in a vertebral column, as in the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, in
Ireland. They vary exceedingly in respect to length and diameter.
Dr. MacCulloch mentions some in Skye which are about 400 feet long;
others, in Morven, not exceeding an inch. In regard to diameter,
those of Ailsa measure nine feet, and those of Morven an inch or
less.* They are usually straight, but sometimes curved; and
examples of both these occur in the island of Staffa. In a
horizontal bed or sheet of trap the columns are vertical; in a
vertical dike they are horizontal.</p>

</center>

<p>It being assumed that columnar trap has consolidated from a
fluid state, the prisms are said to be always at right angles to
the <i>cooling surfaces.</i> If these surfaces, therefore, instead
of being either perpendicular or horizontal, are curved, the
columns ought to be inclined at every angle to the horizon; and
there is a beautiful exemplification of this phenomenon in one of
the valleys of the Vivarais, a mountainous</p>

<p>district in the South of France, where, in the midst of a region
of gneiss, a geologist encounters unexpectedly several volcanic
cones of loose sand and scori&aelig;. From the crater of one of
these cones, called La Coupe d&rsquo;Ayzac, a stream of lava has
descended and occupied the bottom of a narrow valley, except at
those points where the river Volant, or the torrents which join it,
have cut away portions of the solid lava. Fig. 588 represents the
remnant of the lava at one of these points. It is clear that the
lava once filled the whole valley up to the dotted line <i>d a</i>;
but the river has gradually swept away all below that line, while
the tributary torrent has laid open a transverse section; by which
we perceive, in the first place, that the lava is composed, as
usual in this country, of three parts: the uppermost, at <i>a,</i>
being scoriaceous, the second <i>b,</i> presenting irregular
prisms; and the third, <i>c,</i> with regular columns, which are
vertical on the banks of the Volant, where they rest on a
horizontal base of gneiss, but which are inclined at an angle of
45&deg;, at <i>g,</i> and are nearly horizontal at <i>f,</i> their
position having been everywhere determined, according to the law
before mentioned, by the form of the original valley.</p>

<img src="images4/fig589.jpg" width="172" height="251" alt=
"Fig. 589: Columnar basalt in the Vicentin." align="right"> 

<p>In Fig. 589, a view is given of some of the inclined and curved
columns which present themselves on the sides of the valleys in the
hilly region north of Vicenza, in Italy, and at the foot of the
higher Alps.* Unlike those of the Vivarais, last mentioned, the
basalt of this country was evidently submarine, and the present
valleys have since been hollowed out by denudation.</p>

<p>The columnar structure is by no means peculiar to the trap rocks
in which augite abounds; it is also observed in trachyte, and other
feldspathic rocks of the igneous class, although in these it is
rarely exhibited in such regular polygonal forms. It has been
already stated that basaltic columns are often divided by
cross-joints. Sometimes each segment, instead of an angular,
assumes a spheroidal form, so that a pillar is made up of a pile of
balls, usually flattened, as in the Cheese-grotto at
Bertrich-Baden, in the Eifel, near the Moselle (Fig. 590). The
basalt there is part of a small</p>

from one of several volcanic craters, still extant, on the
neighbouring heights.</p>

<p>In some masses of decomposing greenstone, basalt, and other trap
rocks, the globular structure is so conspicuous that the rock has
the appearance of a heap of large cannon balls. According to M.
Delesse, the centre of each spheroid has been a centre of
crystallisation, around which the different minerals of the rock
arranged themselves symmetrically during the process of cooling.
But it was also, he says, a centre of contraction, produced by the
same cooling, the globular form, therefore, of such spheroids being
the combined result of crystallisation and contraction.*</p>

are of an ellipsoidal form (see Fig. 591). The whole rock is in a
state of decomposition, &ldquo;and when the balls,&rdquo; says Mr.

<p><b>Volcanic or Trap Dikes.</b>&mdash;The leading varieties of
the trappean rocks&mdash;basalt, greenstone, trachyte, and the rest&mdash;are
found sometimes in dikes penetrating stratified and unstratified
formations, sometimes in shapeless masses protruding through or
overlying them, or in horizontal sheets intercalated between
strata. Fissures have already been spoken of as occurring in all
kinds of rocks, some a few feet, others many yards in width, and
often filled up with earth or angular pieces of stone, or with sand
and pebbles. Instead of such materials, suppose a quantity of
melted stone to be driven or injected into an open rent, and there
consolidated, we have then a tabular mass resembling a wall, and
called a trap dike. It is not uncommon to find such dikes passing
through strata of soft materials, such as tuff, scori&aelig;, or
shale, which, being more perishable than the trap, are often washed
away by the sea, rivers, or rain, in which case the dike stands
prominently out in the face of precipices, or on the level surface
of a country (see Fig. 592).</p>

<p>In the islands of Arran and Skye, and in other parts of
Scotland, where sandstone, conglomerate, and other hard rocks are
traversed by dikes of trap, the converse of the above phenomenon is
seen. The dike, having decomposed more rapidly than the containing
rock, has once more left open the original fissure, often for a
distance of many yards inland from the sea-coast. There is yet
another case, by no means uncommon in Arran and other parts of
Scotland, where the strata in contact with the dike, and for a
certain distance from it, have been hardened, so as to resist the
action of the weather more than the dike itself, or the surrounding
rocks. When this happens, two parallel walls of indurated strata
are seen protruding above the general level of the country and
following the course of the dike. In Fig. 593, a ground plan is
given of a ramifying dike of greenstone,</p>

<p>In the Hebrides and other countries, the same masses of trap
which occupy the surface of the country far and wide, concealing
the subjacent stratified rocks, are seen also in the sea-cliffs,
prolonged downward in veins or dikes, which probably unite with
other masses of igneous rock at a greater depth. The largest of the
dikes represented in Fig. 594, and which are seen in part of the
coast of Skye, is no less than 100 feet in width.</p>

<p>Every variety of trap-rock is sometimes found in dikes, as
basalt, greenstone, feldspar-porphyry, and trachyte. The
amygdaloidal traps also occur, though more rarely, and even tuff
and breccia, for the materials of these last may be washed down
into open fissures at the bottom of the sea, or during eruption on
the land may be showered into them from the air. Some dikes of trap
may be followed for leagues uninterruptedly in nearly a straight
direction, as in the north of England, showing that the fissures
which they fill must have been of extraordinary length.</p>

<p><b>Rocks altered by Volcanic Dikes.</b>&mdash;After these
remarks on the form and composition of dikes themselves, I shall
describe the alterations which they sometimes produce in the rocks
in contact with them. The changes are usually such as the heat of
melted matter and of the entangled steam and gases might be
expected to cause.</p>

<p><i>Plas-Newydd: Dike cutting through Shale.</i>&mdash;A striking
example,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 515">[ 515 ]</a></p>

<p>near Plas-Newydd, in Anglesea, has been described by Professor
Henslow.* The dike is 134 feet wide, and consists of a rock which
is a compound of feldspar and augite (dolerite of some authors).
Strata of shale and argillaceous limestone, through which it cuts
perpendicularly, are altered to a distance of 30, or even, in some
places, of 35 feet from the edge of the dike. The shale, as it
approaches the trap, becomes gradually more compact, and is most
indurated where nearest the junction. Here it loses part of its
schistose structure, but the separation into parallel layers is
still discernible. In several places the shale is converted into
hard porcelanous jasper. In the most hardened part of the mass the
fossil shells, principally <i>Producti,</i> are nearly obliterated;
yet even here their impressions may frequently be traced. The
argillaceous limestone undergoes analogous mutations, losing its
earthy texture as it approaches the dike, and becoming granular and
crystalline. But the most extraordinary phenomenon is the
appearance in the shale of numerous crystals of analcime and
garnet, which are distinctly confined to those portions of the rock
affected by the dike.&dagger; Some garnets contain as much as 20
per cent of lime, which they may have derived from the
decomposition of the fossil shells or <i>Producti.</i> The same
mineral has been observed, under very analogous circumstances, in
High Teesdale, by Professor Sedgwick, where it also occurs in shale
and limestone, altered by basalt.&Dagger;</p>

<p><i>Antrim: Dike cutting through Chalk.</i>&mdash;In several
parts of the county of Antrim, in the north of Ireland, chalk with
flints is traversed by basaltic dikes. The chalk is there converted
into granular marble near the basalt, the change sometimes
extending eight or ten feet from the wall of the dike, being
greatest near the point of contact, and thence gradually decreasing
till it becomes evanescent. &ldquo;The extreme effect,&rdquo; says
Dr. Berger, &ldquo;presents a dark brown crystalline limestone, the
crystals running in flakes as large as those of coarse primitive
(<i>metamorphic</i>) limestone; the next state is saccharine, then
fine grained and arenaceous; a compact variety, having a
porcelanous aspect and a bluish-grey colour, succeeds: this,
towards the outer edge, becomes yellowish-white, and insensibly
graduates into the unaltered chalk. The flints in the altered chalk
usually assume a grey yellowish colour.&rdquo;&sect; All traces of
organic remains are effaced in that part of the limestone which is
most crystalline.</p>

the north-east of Ireland has converted a mass of red sandstone
into hornstone. By another, the shale of the coal-measures has been
indurated, assuming the character of flinty slate; and in another
place the slate-clay of the lias has been changed into flinty
slate, which still retains numerous impressions of
ammonites.&dagger;</p>

<p>It might have been anticipated that beds of coal would, from
their combustible nature, be affected in an extraordinary degree by
the contact of melted rock. Accordingly, one of the greenstone
dikes of Antrim, on passing through a bed of coal, reduces it to a
cinder for the space of nine feet on each side. At Cockfield Fell,
in the north of England, a similar change is observed. Specimens
taken at the distance of about thirty yards from the trap are not
distinguishable from ordinary pit-coal; those nearer the dike are
like cinders, and have all the character of coke; while those close
to it are converted into a substance resembling soot.&Dagger;</p>

<p>It is by no means uncommon to meet with the same rocks, even in
the same districts, absolutely unchanged in the proximity of
volcanic dikes. This great inequality in the effects of the igneous
rocks may often arise from an original difference in their
temperature, and in that of the entangled gases, such as is
ascertained to prevail in different lavas, or in the same lava near
its source and at a distance from it. The power also of the invaded
rocks to conduct heat may vary,</p>

<p>according to their composition, structure, and the fractures
which they may have experienced, and perhaps, also, according to
the quantity of water (so capable of being heated) which they
contain. It must happen in some cases that the component materials
are mixed in such proportions as to prepare them readily to enter
into chemical union, and form new minerals; while in other cases
the mass may be more homogeneous, or the proportions less adapted
for such union.</p>

<p>We must also take into consideration, that one fissure may be
simply filled with lava, which may begin to cool from the first;
whereas in other cases the fissure may give passage to a current of
melted matter, which may ascend for days or months, feeding streams
which are overflowing the country above, or being ejected in the
shape of scori&aelig; from some crater. If the walls of a rent,
moreover, are heated by hot vapour before the lava rises, as we
know may happen on the flanks of a volcano, the additional heat
supplied by the dike and its gases will act more powerfully.</p>

<p><b>Intrusion of Trap between Strata.</b>&mdash;Masses of trap
are not unfrequently met with intercalated between strata, and
maintaining their parallelism to the planes of stratification
throughout large areas. They must in some places have forced their
way laterally between the divisions of the strata, a direction in
which there would be the least resistance to an advancing fluid, if
no vertical rents communicated with the surface, and a powerful
hydrostatic pressure were caused by gases propelling the lava
upward.</p>

<p><b>Relation of Trappean Rocks to the Products of active
Volcanoes.</b>&mdash;When we reflect on the changes above described
in the strata near their contact with trap dikes, and consider how
complete is the analogy or often identity in composition and
structure of the rocks called trappean and the lavas of active
volcanoes, it seems difficult at first to understand how so much
doubt could have prevailed for half a century as to whether trap
was of igneous or aqueous origin. To a certain extent, however,
there was a real distinction between the trappean formations and
those to which the term volcanic was almost exclusively confined. A
large portion of the trappean rocks first studied in the north of
Germany, and in Norway, France, Scotland, and other countries, were
such as had been formed entirely under water, or had been injected
into fissures and intruded between strata, and which had never
flowed out in the air, or over the bottom of a shallow sea. When
these products, therefore, of submarine or subterranean igneous
action were contrasted with loose cones of scori&aelig;, tuff, and
lava, or with narrow streams of lava in</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 518">[ 518 ]</a></p>

<p>great part scoriaceous and porous, such as were observed to have
proceeded from Vesuvius and Etna, the resemblance seemed remote and
equivocal. It was, in truth, like comparing the roots of a tree
with its leaves and branches, which, although the belong to the
same plant, differ in form, texture, colour, mode of growth, and
position. The external cone, with its loose ashes and porous lava,
may be likened to the light foliage and branches, and the rocks
concealed far below, to the roots. But it is not enough to say of
the volcano,</p>

<pre>
                  &ldquo;Quantum vertice in auras
     &AElig;therias, tantum radice in Tartara tendit,&rdquo;
</pre>

<p>for its roots do literally reach downward to Tartarus, or to the
regions of subterranean fire; and what is concealed far below is
probably always more important in volume and extent than what is
visible above ground.</p>

"Fig. 596: Strata intercepted by a trap dike, and covered with alluvium."

<p>We have already stated how frequently dense masses of strata
have been removed by denudation from wide areas (see <a href=
"ch6.html">Chapter VI</a>); and this fact prepares us to expect a
similar destruction of whatever may once have formed the uppermost
part of ancient submarine or suba&euml;rial volcanoes, more
especially as those superficial parts are always of the lightest
and most perishable materials. The abrupt manner in which dikes of
trap usually terminate at the surface (see Fig. 596), and the
water-worn pebbles of trap in the alluvium which covers the dike,
prove incontestably that whatever was uppermost in these formations
has been swept away. It is easy, therefore, to conceive that what
is gone in regions of trap may have corresponded to what is now
visible in active volcanoes.</p>

<p>As to the absence of porosity in the trappean formations, the
appearances are in a great degree deceptive, for all amygdaloids
are, as already explained, porous rocks, into the cells of which
mineral matter such as silex, carbonate of lime, and other
ingredients, have been subsequently introduced (see <a href=
"#page 507">p. 507</a>); sometimes, perhaps, by secretion during
the cooling and consolidation of lavas. In the Little Cumbray, one
of the Western Islands, near Arran, the amygdaloid sometimes
contains elongated cavities filled with brown spar; and when the
nodules have been washed out, the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 519">[ 519 ]</a></p>

<p>interior of the cavities is glazed with the vitreous varnish so
characteristic of the pores of slaggy lavas. Even in some parts of
this rock which are excluded from air and water, the cells are
empty, and seem to have always remained in this state, and are
therefore undistinguishable from some modern lavas.*</p>

<p>Dr. MacCulloch, after examining with great attention these and
the other igneous rocks of Scotland, observes, &ldquo;that it is a
mere dispute about terms, to refuse to the ancient eruptions of
trap the name of submarine volcanoes; for they are such in every
essential point, although they no longer eject fire and
smoke.&rdquo; The same author also considers it not improbable that
some of the volcanic rocks of the same country may have been poured
out in the open air.&dagger;</p>

<p>It will be seen in the following chapters that in the
earth&rsquo;s crust there are volcanic tuffs of all ages,
containing marine shells, which bear witness to eruptions at many
successive geological periods. These tuffs, and the associated
trappean rocks, must not be compared to lava and scori&aelig; which
had cooled in the open air. Their counterparts must be sought in
the products of modern submarine volcanic eruptions. If it be
objected that we have no opportunity of studying these last, it may
be answered, that subterranean movements have caused, almost
everywhere in regions of active volcanoes, great changes in the
relative level of land and sea, in times comparatively modern, so
as to expose to view the effects of volcanic operations at the
bottom of the sea.</p>
