<p><b>Beds of Passage between the Lias and Trias&mdash;Rh&aelig;tic
Beds.</b>&mdash;We have mentioned in the last chapter (<a href=
"ch20.html#page 356">p. 356</a>) that the base of the Lower Lias is
characterised, both in England and Germany, by beds containing
distinct species of Ammonites, the lowest subdivision having been
called the zone of <i>Ammonites planorbis.</i> Below this zone, on
the boundary line between the Lias and the strata of which we are
about to treat, called &ldquo;Trias,&rdquo; certain cream-coloured
limestones devoid of fossils are usually found. These white beds
were called by William Smith the White Lias, and they have been
shown by Mr. Charles Moore to belong to a formation similar to one
in the Rh&aelig;tian Alps of Bavaria, to which Mr. Gumbel has
applied the name of Rh&aelig;tic. They have also long been known as
the Koessen beds in Germany, and may be regarded as beds of passage
between the Lias and Trias. They are named the Penarth beds by the
Government surveyors of Great Britain, from Penarth, near Cardiff,
in Glamorganshire, where they sometimes attain a thickness of fifty
feet.</p>

<p>The principal member of this group has been called by Dr. Wright
the <i>Avicula contorta</i> bed,* as this shell is very abundant,
and has a wide range in Europe. General Portlock first described
the formation as it occurs at Portrush, in Antrim, where the <i>
Avicula contorta</i> is accompanied by <i>Pecten Valoniensis,</i>
as in Germany.</p>

<p>The best known member of the group, a thin band or bone-breccia,
is conspicuous among the black shales in the neigh-</p>

<p>bourhood of Axmouth in Devonshire, and in the cliffs of
Westbury-on-Severn, as well as at Aust and other places on the
borders of the Bristol Channel. It abounds in the remains of
saurians and fish, and was formerly classed as the lowest bed of
the Lias; but Sir P. Egerton first pointed out, in 1841, that it
should be referred to the Upper New Red Sandstone, because it
contained an assemblage of fossil fish which are either peculiar to
this stratum, or belong to species well-known in the Muschelkalk of
Germany. These fish belong to the genera <i>Acrodus, Hybodus,
Gyrolepis,</i> and <i>Saurichthys.</i></p>

<p>Among those common to the English bone-bed and the Muschelkalk

and <i>G. Albertii.</i> Remains of saurians, <i>Plesiosaurus</i>
among others, have also been found in the bone-bed, and plates of
an <i>Encrinus.</i> It may be questioned whether some of those
fossils which have the most Triassic character may</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 368">[ 368 ]</a></p>

<p>not have been derived from the destruction of older strata,
since in bone-beds, in general, many of the organic remains are
undoubtedly derivative.</p>

<img src="images3/fig389.jpg" width="246" height="158" alt=
"Fig. 389: Microlestes antiquus, molar tooth." align="left"> 

<p><i>Triassic Mammifer.</i>&mdash;In North-western Germany, as in
England, there occurs beneath the Lias a remarkable bone breccia.
It is filled with shells and with the remains of fishes and
reptiles, almost all the genera of which, and some even of the
species, agree with those of the subjacent Trias. This breccia has
accordingly been considered by Professor Quenstedt, and other
German geologists of high authority, as the newest or uppermost
part of the Trias. Professor Plieninger found in it, in 1847, the
molar tooth of a small Triassic mammifer, called by him <i>
Microlestes antiquus.</i> He inferred its true nature from its
double fangs, and from the form and number of the protuberances or
cusps on the flat crown; and considering it as predaceous, probably
insectivorous, he called it <i>Microlestes</i> from micros, little,
and lestes, a beast of prey. Soon afterwards he found a second
tooth, also at the same locality, Diegerloch, about two miles to
the south-east of Stuttgart.</p>

<p>No anatomist had been able to give any feasible conjecture as to
the affinities of this minute quadruped until Dr. Falconer, in
1857, recognised an unmistakable resemblance between its teeth and
the two back molars of his new genus <i>Plagiaulax</i> (<a href=
"images2/fig306.jpg">Fig. 306</a>), from the Purbeck strata. This
would lead us to the conclusion that Microlestes was marsupial and
plant-eating.</p>

<p>In W&uuml;rtemberg there are two bone-beds, namely, that
containing the Microlestes, which has just been described, which
constitutes, as we have seen, the uppermost member of the Trias,
and another of still greater extent, and still more rich in the
remains of fish and reptiles, which is of older date, intervening
between the Keuper and Muschelkalk.</p>

<p>The genera <i>Saurichthys, Hybodus,</i> and <i>Gyrolepis</i> are
found in both these breccias, and one of the species, <i>
Saurichthys Mongeoti,</i> is common to both bone-beds, as is also a
remarkable reptile called <i>Nothosaurus mirabilis.</i> The saurian
called <i>Belodon</i> by H. von Meyer, of the Thecodont family, is
another Triassic form, associated at Diegerloch with
Microlestes.</p>

<center><small>TRIAS OF ENGLAND.</small></center>

<p>Between the Lias and the Coal (or Carboniferous group) there is
interposed, in the midland and western counties of England, a great
series of red loams, shales, and sandstones, to which the name of
the &ldquo;New Red Sandstone formation&rdquo; was first given, to
distinguish it from other shales and sandstones called the
&ldquo;Old Red,&rdquo; often identical in mineral character, which
lie immediately beneath the coal. The name of &ldquo;Red
Marl&rdquo; has been incorrectly applied to the red clays of this
formation, as before explained (<a href="ch2.html#page 38">p.
38</a>), for they are remarkably free from calcareous matter. The
absence, indeed, of carbonate of lime, as well as the scarcity of
organic remains, together with the bright red colour of most of the
rocks of this group, causes a strong contrast between it and the
Jurassic formations before described.</p>

<p>The group in question is more fully developed in Germany than in
England or France. It has been called the Trias by German writers,
or the Triple Group, because it is separable into three distinct
formations, called the &ldquo;Keuper,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Muschelkalk,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Bunter-sandstein.&rdquo;
Of these the middle division, or the Muschelkalk, is wholly wanting
in England, and the uppermost (Keuper) and lowest (Bunter) members
of the series are not rich in fossils.</p>

<p><b>Upper Trias or Keuper.</b>&mdash;In certain grey indurated
marls below the bone-bed Mr. Boyd Dawkins has found at Watchet, on
the coast of Somersetshire, a molar tooth of Microlestes, enabling
him to refer to the Trias strata formerly supposed to be Liassic.
Mr. Charles Moore had previously discovered many teeth of mammalia
of the same family near Frome, in Somersetshire, in the contents of
a vertical fissure traversing a mass of carboniferous limestone.
The top of this fissure must have communicated with the bed of the
Triassic sea, and probably at a point not far from the ancient
shore on which the small marsupials of that era abounded.</p>

<p>This upper division of the Trias called the Keuper is of great
thickness in the central counties of England, attaining, according
to Mr. Hull&rsquo;s estimate, no less than 3450 feet in Cheshire,
and it covers a large extent of country between Lancashire and
Devonshire.</p>

<p>In Worcestershire and Warwickshire in sandstone belonging to the
uppermost part of the Keuper the bivalve crustacean <i>Estheria
minuta</i> occurs. The member of the English &ldquo;New Red&rdquo;
containing this shell, in those parts of England, is, according to
Sir Roderick Murchison and Mr. Strickland, 600 feet thick, and
consists chiefly of red marl or slate, with</p>

<p>a band of sandstone. Ichthyodorulites, or spines of <i>
Hybodus,</i> teeth of fishes, and footprints of reptiles were
observed by the same geologists in these strata.</p>

<img src="images3/fig391.jpg" width="276" height="260" alt=
"Fig. 391: Hyperodapedon Gordoni. Left Plate, Maxillary." align=
"left"> 

<p>In the Upper Trias or Keuper the remains of two saurians of the
order Lacertilia have been found. The one called <i>
Rhynchosaurus</i> occurred at Grinsell near Shrewsbury, and is
characterised by having a small bird-like skull and jaws without
teeth. The other <i>Hyperodapedon</i> (Fig. 391) was first noticed
in 1858, near Elgin, in strata now recognised as Upper Triassic,
and afterwards in beds of about the same age in the neighbourhood
of Warwick. Remains of the same genus have been found both in
Central India and Southern Africa in rocks believed to be of
Triassic age. The Hyperodapedon has been shown by Professor Huxley
to be a terrestrial reptile having numerous palatal teeth, and
closely allied to the living Sphenodon of New Zealand.</p>

<p>The recent discoveries of a living saurian in New Zealand so
closely allied to this supposed extinct division of the Lacertilia
seems to afford an illustration of a principle pointed out by Mr.
Darwin of the survival in insulated tracts, after many changes in
physical geography, of orders of which the congeners have become
extinct on continents where they have been exposed to the severer
competition of a larger progressive fauna.</p>

<img src="images3/fig392.jpg" width="85" height="138" alt=
"Fig. 392: Tooth of Labyrinthodon." align="right"> 

<p>Teeth of Labyrinthodon (Fig. 392) found in the Keuper in
Warwickshire were examined microscopically by Professor Owen, and
compared with other teeth from the German Keuper. He found after
careful investigation that neither of them could be referred to
true saurians, although they had been named <i>Mastodonsaurus</i>
and <i>Phytosaurus</i> by J&auml;ger. It appeared that they were of
the <i>Batrachian</i> order, and of gigantic</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 371">[ 371 ]</a></p>

<p>dimensions in comparison with any representatives of that order
now living. Both the Continental and English fossil teeth exhibited
a most complicated texture, differing from that previously observed
in any reptile, whether recent or extinct, but most nearly
analogous to the <i>Ichthyosaurus.</i> A section of one of these
teeth exhibits a series of irregular folds, resembling the
labyrinthic windings of the surface of the brain; and from this
character Professor Owen has proposed the name Labyrinthodon for
the new genus. Fig. 393 of part of one is given from his
&ldquo;Odontography,&rdquo; plate 64, A. The entire length of this
tooth is supposed to have been about three inches and a half, and
the breadth at the base one inch and a half.</p>

</center>

<p><i>Rock-salt.</i>&mdash;In Cheshire and Lancashire there are red
clays containing gypsum and salt of the age of the Trias which are
between 1000 and 1500 feet thick. In some places lenticular masses
of pure rock-salt nearly 100 feet thick are interpolated between
the argillaceous beds. At the base of the formation beneath the
rock-salt occur the Lower Sandstones and Marl, called provincially
in Cheshire &ldquo;water-stones,&rdquo; which are largely quarried
for building. They are often ripple-marked, and are impressed with
numerous footprints of reptiles.</p>

<p>The basement beds of the Keuper rest with a slight</p>

&ldquo;Bunter&rdquo; next to be described.</p>

<img src="images3/fig394.jpg" width="170" height="192" alt=
"Fig. 394: Single footstep of Cheirotherium." align="left"> 

<p><b>Lower Trias or Bunter.</b>&mdash;The lower division or
English representative of the &ldquo;Bunter&rdquo; attains a
thickness of 1500 feet in the counties last mentioned, according to
Professor Ramsay. Besides red and green shales and red sandstones,
it comprises much soft white quartzose sandstone, in which the
trunks of silicified trees have been met with at Allesley Hill,
near Coventry. Several of them were a foot and a half in diameter,
and some yards in length, decidedly of coniferous wood, and showing
rings of annual growth.* Impressions, also, of the footsteps of
animals have been detected in Lancashire and Cheshire in this
formation. Some of the most remarkable occur a few miles from
Liverpool, in the whitish quartzose sandstone of Storton Hill, on
the west side of the Mersey. They bear a close resemblance to
tracks first observed in this member of the Upper New Red
Sandstone, at the village of Hesseberg, near Hildburghausen, in
Saxony. For many years these footprints have been referred to a
large unknown quadruped, provisionally named <i>Cheirotherium</i>
by Professor Kaup, because the marks both of the fore and hind feet
resembled impressions made by a human hand. (See Fig. 394.) The
foot-marks at Hesseberg are partly concave, and partly in relief,
the former, or the depressions, are seen upon the upper surface of
the sandstone slabs, but those in relief are only upon the lower
surfaces, being, in fact, natural casts, formed in the subjacent
footprints as in moulds. The larger impressions, which seem to be
those of the hind foot, are generally eight inches in length, and
five in width, and one was twelve inches long. Near each large
footstep, and at a regular distance (about an inch and a half)
before it, a smaller print of a fore foot, four inches long and
three inches wide, occurs. The footsteps follow each other</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 373">[ 373 ]</a></p>

<p>in pairs, each pair in the same line, at intervals of fourteen
inches from pair to pair. The large as well as the small steps show
the great toes alternately on the right and left side; each step
makes the print of five toes, the first, or great toe, being bent
inward like a thumb. Though the fore and hind foot differ so much
in size, they are nearly similar in form.</p>

<p>As neither in Germany nor in England had any bones or teeth been
met with in the same identical strata as the footsteps, anatomists
indulged, for several years, in various conjectures respecting the
mysterious animals from which they might have been derived.
Professor Kaup suggested that the unknown quadruped might have been
allied to the <i>Marsupialia</i>; for in the kangaroo the first toe
of the fore foot is in a similar manner set obliquely to the
others, like a thumb, and the disproportion between the fore and
hind feet is also very great. But M. Link conceived that some of
the four species of animals of which the tracks had been found in
Saxony might have been gigantic <i>Batrachians,</i> and when it was
afterwards inferred that the Labyrinthodon was an air-breathing
reptile, it was conjectured by Professor Owen that it might be one
and the same as the Cheirotherium.</p>

<p><b>Dolomitic Conglomerate of Bristol.</b>&mdash;Near Bristol, in
Somersetshire, and in other counties bordering the Severn, the
lowest strata belonging to the Triassic series consist of a
conglomerate or breccia resting unconformably upon the Old Red
Sandstone, and on different members of the Carboniferous rocks,
such as the Coal Measures, Millstone Grit, and Mountain Limestone.
This mode of superposition will be understood by reference to the
section below Dundry Hill (<a href="images/fig85.jpg">Fig. 85</a>),
where No. 4 is the dolomitic conglomerate. Such breccias may have
been partly the result of the sub&AElig;rial waste of an old
land-surface which gradually sank down and suffered littoral
denudation in proportion as it became submerged. The pebbles and
fragments of older rocks which constitute the conglomerate are
cemented together by a red or yellow base of dolomite, and in some
places the encrinites and other fossils derived from the Mountain
Limestone are so detached from the parent rocks that they have the
deceptive appearance of belonging to a fauna contemporaneous with
the dolomitic beds in which they occur. The imbedded fragments are
both rounded and angular, some consisting of sandstone from the
coal-measures, being of vast size, and weighing nearly a ton.
Fractured bones and teeth of saurians which are truly of
contemporaneous origin are dispersed through some parts of the
breccia, and two of these reptiles called Thecodont saurians, named
from the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 374">[ 374 ]</a></p>

<p>manner in which the teeth were implanted in the jawbone,
obtained great celebrity because the patches of red conglomerate in
which they were found, near Bristol, were originally supposed to be
of Permian or Pal&aelig;ozoic age, and therefore the only
representatives in England of vertebrate animals of so high a grade
in rocks of such antiquity. The teeth of these saurians are
conical, compressed, and with finely serrated edges (see Fig. 396);
they are referred by Professor Huxley to the Dinosaurian order.</p>

<img src="images3/fig396.jpg" width="133" height="204" alt=
"Fig. 396: Tooth of Thecodontosaurus." align="left"> 

<p><b>Origin of Red Sandstone and Rock-salt.</b>&mdash;In various
parts of the world, red and mottled clays and sandstones, of
several distinct geological epochs, are found associated with salt,
gypsum, and magnesian limestone, or with one or all of these
substances. There is, therefore, in all likelihood, a general cause
for such a coincidence. Nevertheless, we must not forget that there
are dense masses of red and variegated sandstones and clays,
thousands of feet in thickness, and of vast horizontal extent,
wholly devoid of saliferous or gypseous matter. There are also
deposits of gypsum and of common salt, as in the blue-clay
formation of Sicily, without any accompanying red sandstone or red
clay.</p>

<p>These red deposits may be accounted for by the decomposition of
gneiss and mica schist, which in the eastern Grampians of Scotland
has produced a mass of detritus of precisely the same colour as the
Old Red Sandstone.</p>

<p>It is a general fact, and one not yet accounted for, that
scarcely any fossil remains are ever preserved in stratified rocks
in which this oxide of iron abounds; and when we find fossils in
the New or Old Red Sandstone in England, it is in the grey, and
usually calcareous beds, that they occur. The saline or gypseous
interstratified beds may have been produced by submarine gaseous
emanations, or hot mineral springs, which often continue to flow in
the same spots for ages. Beds of rock-salt are, however, more
generally attributed to the evaporation of lakes or lagoons
communicating at intervals with the ocean. In Cheshire two beds of
salt occur of the extraordinary thickness of 90 or even 100 feet,
and extending over an area supposed to be 150 miles in diameter.
The adjacent beds present ripple-marked sandstones and footprints
of animals at so many levels as to imply that the whole area
underwent a slow and gradual depression during the formation of the
red sandstone.</p>

<p>Major Harris, in his &ldquo;Highlands of Ethiopia,&rdquo;
describes a</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 375">[ 375 ]</a></p>

<p>salt lake, called the Bahr Assal, near the Abyssinian frontier,
which once formed the prolongation of the Gulf of Tadjara, but was
afterwards cut off from the gulf by a broad bar of lava or of land
upraised by an earthquake. &ldquo;Fed by no rivers, and exposed in
a burning climate to the unmitigated rays of the sun, it has shrunk
into an elliptical basin, seven miles in its transverse axis, half
filled with smooth water of the deepest c&aelig;rulean hue, and
half with a solid sheet of glittering snow-white salt, the
offspring of evaporation.&rdquo; &ldquo;If,&rdquo; says Mr. Hugh
Miller, &ldquo;we suppose, instead of a barrier of lava, that
sand-bars were raised by the surf on a flat arenaceous coast during
a slow and equable sinking of the surface, the waters of the outer
gulf might occasionally topple over the bar, and supply fresh brine
when the first stock had been exhausted by evaporation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Runn of Cutch, as I have shown elsewhere,* is a low region
near the delta of the Indus, equal in extent to about a quarter of
Ireland, which is neither land nor sea, being dry during part of
every year, and covered by salt water during the monsoons. Here and
there its surface is incrusted over with a layer of salt caused by
the evaporation of sea-water. A subsiding movement has been
witnessed in this country during earthquakes, so that a great
thickness of pure salt might result from a continuation of such
sinking.</p>

to those of the oolite and lias, consisting of ferns, equisetaceous
plants, cycads, and conifers, with a few doubtful monocotyledons. A
few species such as <i>Equisetites columnaris,</i> are common to
this group and the oolite.</p>

<p><i>St. Cassian and Hallstadt Beds</i> (see Map, Fig.
398).&mdash; The sandstones and clay of the Keuper resemble the
deposits of estuaries and a shallow sea near the land, and afford,
in the N.W. of Germany, as in France and England, but a scanty
representation of the marine life of that period. We might,
however, have anticipated, from its rich reptilian fauna, that the
contemporaneous inhabitants of the sea of the Keuper period would
be very numerous, should we ever have an opportunity of bringing
their remains to light. This, it is believed, has at length been
accomplished, by the position now assigned to certain Alpine rocks
called the &ldquo;St. Cassian beds,&rdquo; the true place of which
in the series was until lately a subject of much doubt and
discussion. It has been proved that the Hallstadt beds on the
northern flanks of the Austrian Alps correspond in age with the St.
Cassian beds on their southern declivity, and the Austrian
geologists, M. Suess of Vienna and others, have satisfied
themselves that the Hallstadt formation is referable to the period
of the Upper Trias.</p>

<p>Assuming this conclusion to be correct, we become acquainted
suddenly and unexpectedly with a rich marine fauna belonging to a
period previously believed to be very barren of organic remains,
because in England, France, and Northern Germany the upper Trias is
chiefly represented by beds of fresh or brackish water origin.</p>

<p>About 600 species of invertebrate fossils occur in the Hallstadt
and St. Cassian beds, many of which are still undescribed; some of
the Mollusca are of new and peculiar genera, as <i>Scoliostoma,</i>
Fig. 399, and <i>Platystoma,</i> Fig. 400, among the Gasteropoda;
and <i>Koninckia,</i> Fig. 401, among the Brachiopoda.</p>

<p>The first column marks the last appearance of several genera
which are characteristic of Pal&aelig;ozoic strata. The second
shows those genera which are characteristic of the Upper Trias,
either as peculiar to it, or, as in the three cases marked by
asterisks, reaching their maximum of development at this era. The
third column marks the first appearance in Triassic rocks of genera
destined to become more abundant in later ages.</p>

<p>It is only, however, when we contemplate the number of species
by which each of the above-mentioned genera are represented that we
comprehend the peculiarities of what is commonly called the St.
Cassian fauna. Thus, for example, the Ammonite, which is not common
to older rocks, is represented by no less than seventy-three
species; whereas Loxonema, which is only known as common to older
rocks, furnishes fifteen Triassic species. Cerithium, so abundant
in tertiary strata, and which still lives, is represented by no
less than fourteen species. As the Orthoceras had never been met
with in the marine Muschelkalk, much surprise was naturally felt
that seven or eight species of the genus should appear in the
Hallstadt beds, assuming these last to belong to the Upper Trias.
Among these species are some of large dimensions, associated with
large Ammonites with foliated lobes, a form never seen before so
low in the series, while the Orthoceras had never been seen so
high.</p>

<p>On the whole, the rich marine fauna of Hallstadt and St.
Cassian, now generally assigned to the lowest members of the Upper
Trias or Keuper, leads us to suspect that when the strata of the
Triassic age are better known, especially those belonging to the
period of the Bunter sandstone, the break between the
Pal&aelig;ozoic and Mesozoic Periods may be almost effaced. Indeed
some geologists are not yet satisfied that the true position of the
St. Cassian beds (containing so great an admixture of types, having
at once both Mesozoic and Pal&aelig;ozoic affinities) is made out,
and doubt whether they have yet been clearly proved to be newer
than the Muschelkalk.</p>

<p><b>Muschelkalk.</b>&mdash;The next member of the Trias in
Germany, the <i>Muschelkalk,</i> which underlies the <i>Keuper</i>
before described, consists chiefly of a compact greyish limestone,
but includes beds of dolomite in many places, together with gypsum
and rock-salt. This limestone, a formation wholly unrepresented in
England, abounds in fossil shells, as the name implies. Among the
Cephalopoda there are no belemnites, and no ammonites with foliated
sutures, as in the Lias, and Oolite, and the Hallstadt beds; but we
find instead a genus allied to</p>

is abundant, ranging through the Keuper, Muschelkalk, and
Bunter-sandstein; and <i>Gervillia socialis</i> (Fig. 403), having
a similar range, is found in great numbers in the Muschelkalk of
Germany, France, and Poland.</p>

<p>The abundance of the heads and stems of lily encrinites, <i>
Encrinus liliiformis</i> (Fig. 404), (or <i>Encrinites
moniliformis</i>), shows the slow manner in which some beds of this
limestone have been formed in clear sea-water. The star-fish called
<i>Aspidura loricata</i> (Fig. 405) is as yet peculiar to the
Muschelkalk. In the same formation are found the skull and teeth of
a reptile of the genus <i>Placodus</i> (see Fig. 406), which was
referred originally by Munster, and afterwards by Agassiz, to the
class of fishes. But more perfect specimens enabled Professor Owen,
in 1858, to show that this fossil animal was a Saurian reptile,
which probably fed on shell-bearing mollusks, and used its short
and flat teeth, so thickly coated with enamel, for pounding and
crushing the shells.</p>

consists of various-coloured sandstones, dolomites, and red clays,
with some beds, especially in the Hartz, of calcareous pisolite or
roe-stone, the whole sometimes attaining a thickness of more than
1000 feet. The sandstone of the Vosges is proved, by its fossils,
to belong to this lowest member of the Triassic group. At Sulzbad
(or Soultz-les-bains), near Strasburg, on the flanks of the Vosges,
many plants have been obtained from the &ldquo;bunter,&rdquo;
especially conifers of the extinct genus <i>Voltzia,</i> of which
the fructification has been preserved. (See Fig. 407.) Out of
thirty species of ferns, cycads, conifers, and other plants,
enumerated by M. Ad. Brongniart, in 1849, as coming from the

<p><b>New Red Sandstone of the Valley of the Connecticut
River.</b>&mdash;In a depression of the granitic or hypogene rocks
in the States of Massachusetts and Connecticut strata of red
sandstone, shale, and conglomerate are found, occupying an area
more than 150 miles in length from north to south, and about five
to ten miles in breadth, the beds dipping to the eastward at angles
varying from 5 to 50 degrees. The extreme inclination of 50 degrees
is rare, and only observed in the neighbourhood of masses of trap
which have been intruded into the red sandstone while it was
forming, or before the newer parts of the deposit had been
completed. Having examined this series of rocks in many places, I
feel satisfied that they were formed in shallow water, and for the
most part near the shore, and that some of the beds were from time
to time raised above the level of the water, and laid dry, while a
newer series, composed of similar sediment, was forming.</p>

<img src="images3/fig408.jpg" width="108" height="437" alt=
"Fig. 408: Foot-prints of a bird, Turner's Falls, Valley of the Connecticut."
 align="right"> 

<p>According to Professor Hitchcock, the footprints of no less than
thirty-two species of bipeds, and twelve of quadrupeds, have been
already detected in these rocks. Thirty of these are believed to be
those of birds, four of lizards, two of chelonians, and six of
batrachians. The tracks have been found in more than twenty places,
scattered through an extent of nearly 80 miles from north to south,
and they are repeated through a succession of beds attaining at
some points a thickness of more than 1000 feet.*</p>

<p>The bipedal impressions are, for the most part, trifid, and show
the same number of joints as exist in the feet of living
tridactylous birds. Now, such birds have three phalangeal bones for
the inner toe, four for the middle, and five for the outer one (see
Fig. 408); but the impression of the terminal joint is that of the
nail only. The fossil footprints exhibit regularly, where the
joints are seen, the same number; and we see in each continuous
line of tracks</p>

iii, p. 129, 1848.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 382">[ 382 ]</a></p>

<p>the three-jointed and five-jointed toes placed alternately
outward, first on the one side, and then on the other. In some
specimens, besides impressions of the three toes in front, the
rudiment is seen of the fourth toe behind. It is not often that the
matrix has been fine enough to retain impressions of the integument
or skin of the foot; but in one fine specimen found at
Turner&rsquo;s Falls, on the Connecticut, by Dr. Deane, these
markings are well preserved, and have been recognised by Professor
Owen as resembling the skin of the ostrich, and not that of
reptiles.</p>

<p>The casts of the footprints show that some of the fossil bipeds
of the red sandstone of Connecticut had feet four times as large as
the living ostrich, but scarcely, perhaps, larger than the Dinornis
of New Zealand, a lost genus of feathered giants related to the
Apteryx, of which there were many species which have left their
bones and almost entire skeletons in the superficial alluvium of
that island. By referring to what was said of the Iguanodon of the
Wealden, the reader will perceive that the Dinosaur was somewhat
intermediate between reptiles and birds, and left a series of
tridactylous impressions on the sand.</p>

<p>To determine the exact age of the red sandstone and shale
containing these ancient footprints, in the United States, is not
possible at present. No fossil shells have yet been found in the
deposit, nor plants in a determinable state. The fossil fish are
numerous and very perfect; but they are of a peculiar type, called
<i>Ischypterus,</i> by Sir Philip Egerton, from the great size and
strength of the fulcral rays of the dorsal fin, from ischus,
strength, and pteron, a fin.</p>

<p>The age of the Connecticut beds can not be proved by direct
superposition, but may be presumed from the general structure of
the country. That structure proves them to be newer than the
movements to which the Appalachian or Allegheny chain owes its
flexures, and this chain includes the ancient or pal&aelig;ozoic
coal-formation among its contorted rocks.</p>

<p><b>Coal-field of Richmond, Virginia.</b>&mdash;In the State of
Virginia, at the distance of about 13 miles eastward of Richmond,
the capital of that State, there is a coal-field occurring in a
depression of the granite rocks, and occupying a geological
position analogous to that of the New Red Sandstone,
above-mentioned, of the Connecticut valley. It extends 26 miles
from north to south, and from four to twelve from east to west.</p>

<p>The plants consist chiefly of zamites, calamites, equiseta, and
ferns, and, upon the whole, are considered by Professor</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 383">[ 383 ]</a></p>

<p>Heer to have the nearest affinity to those of the European
Keuper.</p>

<p>The equiseta are very commonly met with in a vertical position
more or less compressed perpendicularly. It is clear that they grew
in the places where they are now buried in strata of hardened sand
and mud. I found them maintaining their erect attitude, at points
many miles apart, in beds both above and between the seams of coal.
In order to explain this fact, we must suppose such shales and
sandstones to have been gradually accumulated during the slow and
repeated subsidence of the whole region.</p>

<img src="images3/fig409.jpg" width="230" height="164" alt=
"Fig. 409: Triassic coal-shale, Richmond, Virginia." align="right">


<p>The fossil fish are Ganoids, some of them of the genus <i>
Catopterus,</i> others belonging to the liassic genus <i>
Tetragonolepis (&AElig;chmodus),</i> see <a href=
"images3/fig375.jpg">Fig. 376.</a> Two species of <i>
Entomostraca</i> called <i>Estheria</i> are in such profusion in
some shaly beds as to divide them like the plates of mica in
micaceous shales (see Fig. 409).</p>

<p>These Virginian coal-measures are composed of grits, sandstones,
and shales, exactly resembling those of older or primary date in
America and Europe, and they rival, or even surpass, the latter in
the richness and thickness of the coal-seams. One of these, the
main seam, is in some places from 30 to 40 feet thick, composed of
pure bituminous coal. The coal is like the finest kinds shipped at
Newcastle, and when analysed yields the same proportions of carbon
and hydrogen&mdash;a fact worthy of notice, when we consider that
this fuel has been derived from an assemblage of plants very
distinct specifically, and in part generically, from those which
have contributed to the formation of the ancient or pal&aelig;ozoic
coal.</p>

<p><b>Triassic Mammifer.</b>&mdash;In North Carolina, the late
Professor Emmons has described the strata of the Chatham
coal-field, which correspond in age to those near Richmond, in
Virginia. In beds underlying them he has met with three jaws of a
small insectivorous mammal which he has called <i>Dromatherium
sylvestre,</i> closely allied to <i>Spalacotherium.</i> Its nearest
living analogue, says Professor Owen, &ldquo;is found in
Myrmecobius; for each ramus of the lower jaw contained ten small
molars in a continuous series, one canine, and three</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 384">[ 384 ]</a></p>

<p>conical incisors&mdash;the latter being divided by short
intervals.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Low Grade of Early Mammals favourable to the Theory of
Progressive Development.</b>&mdash;There is every reason to believe
that this fossil quadruped is at least as ancient as the
Microlestes of the European Trias described in <a href=
"ch21.html#page 368">p. 368</a>; and the fact is highly important,
as proving that a certain low grade of marsupials had not only a
wide range in time, from the Trias to the Purbeck, or uppermost
oolitic strata of Europe, but had also a wide range in space,
namely, from Europe to North America, in an east and west
direction, and, in regard to latitude, from Stonesfield, in 52&deg;
N., to that of North Carolina, 35&deg; N.</p>

<p>If the three localities in Europe where the most ancient
mammalia have been found&mdash;Purbeck, Stonesfield, and
Stuttgart&mdash;had belonged all of them to formations of the same
age, we might well have imagined so limited an area to have been
peopled exclusively with pouched quadrupeds, just as Australia now
is, while other parts of the globe were inhabited by placentals;
for Australia now supports one hundred and sixty species of
marsupials, while the rest of the continents and islands are
tenanted by about seventeen hundred species of mammalia, of which
only forty-six are marsupial, namely, the opossums of North and
South America. But the great difference of age of the strata in
each of these three localities seems to indicate the predominance
throughout a vast lapse of time (from the era of the Upper Trias to
that of the Purbeck beds) of a low grade of quadrupeds; and this
persistency of similar generic and ordinal types in Europe while
the species were changing, and while the fish, reptiles, and
mollusca were undergoing great modifications, would naturally lead
us to suspect that there must also have been a vast extension in
space of the same marsupial forms during that portion of the
Secondary or Mesozoic epoch which has been termed &ldquo;the age of
reptiles.&rdquo; Such an inference as to the wide geographical
range of the ancient marsupials has been confirmed by the discovery
in the Trias of North America of the above-mentioned Dromatherium.
The predominance in earlier ages of these mammalia of a low grade,
and the absence, so far as our investigations have yet gone, of
species of higher organisation, whether aquatic or terrestrial, is
certainly in favour of the theory of progressive development.</p>
