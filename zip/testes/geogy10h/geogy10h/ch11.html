<p><b>Character and Distribution of Glacial
Drift.</b>&mdash;In speaking of the loose transported matter
commonly found on the surface of the land in all parts of the
globe, I alluded to the exceptional character of what has been
called the boulder formation in the temperate and Arctic latitudes
of the northern hemisphere. The peculiarity of its form in Europe
north of the 50th, and in North America north of the 40th parallel
of latitude, is now universally attributed to the action of ice,
and the difference of opinion respecting it is now chiefly
restricted to the question whether land-ice or floating icebergs
have played the chief part in its distribution. It is wanting in
the warmer and equatorial regions, and reappears when we examine
the lands which lie south of the 40th and 50th parallels in the
southern hemisphere, as, for example, in Patagonia, Tierra del
Fuego, and New Zealand. It consists of sand and clay, sometimes
stratified, but often wholly devoid of stratification for a depth
of 50, 100, or even a greater number of feet. To this unstratified
form of the deposit the name of <i>till</i> has long been applied
in Scotland. It generally contains a mixture of angular and rounded
fragments of rock, some of large size, having occasionally one or
more of their sides flattened and smoothed, or even highly
polished. The smoothed surfaces usually exhibit many scratches
parallel to each other, one set of which often crosses an older
set. The till is almost everywhere wholly devoid of organic
remains, except those washed into it from older formations, though
in some places it contains marine shells, usually of northern
or</p>

<p class="fnote">* As to the former excess of cold, whether brought
about by modifications in the height and distribution of the land
or by altered astronomical conditions, see Principles, vol. i,
(10th ed., 1867), chaps. xii and xiii, &ldquo;Vicissitudes of
Climate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 167">[ 167 ]</a></p>

<p>Arctic species, and frequently in a fragmentary state. The bulk
of the till has usually been derived from the grinding down into
mud of rocks in the immediate neighbourhood, so that it is red in a
region of Red Sandstone, as in Strathmore in Forfarshire; grey or
black in a district of coal and bituminous shale, as around
Edinburgh; and white in a chalk country, as in parts of Norfolk and
Denmark. The stony fragments dispersed irregularly through the till
usually belong, especially in mountainous countries, to rocks found
in some part of the same hydrographical basin; but there are
regions where the whole of the boulder clay has come from a
distance, and huge blocks, or &ldquo;erratics,&rdquo; as they have been called,
many feet in diameter, have not unfrequently travelled hundreds of
miles from their point of departure, or from the parent rocks from
which they have evidently been detached. These are commonly
angular, and have often one or more of their sides polished and
furrowed.</p>

<p>The rock on which the boulder formation reposes, if it consists
of granite, gneiss, marble, or other hard stone, capable of
permanently retaining any superficial markings which may have been
imprinted upon it, is usually smoothed or polished, like the
erratics above described, and exhibits parallel stri&aelig; and
furrows having a determinate direction. This direction, both in
Europe and North America, agrees generally in a marked manner with
the course taken by the erratic blocks in the same district. The
boulder clay, when it was first studied, seemed in many of its
characters so singular and anomalous, that geologists despaired of
ever being able to interpret the phenomena by reference to causes
now in action. In those exceptional cases where marine shells of
the same date as the boulder clay were found, nearly all of them
were recognised as living species&mdash;a fact conspiring with the
superficial position of the drift to indicate a comparatively
modern origin.</p>

<p>The term &ldquo;diluvium&rdquo; was for a time the most popular name of the
boulder formation, because it was referred by many to the deluge of
Noah, while others retained the name as expressive of their opinion
that a series of diluvial waves raised by hurricanes and storms, or
by earthquakes, or by the sudden upheaval of land from the bed of
the sea, had swept over the continents, carrying with them vast
masses of mud and heavy stones, and forcing these stones over rocky
surfaces so as to polish and imprint upon them long furrows and
stri&aelig;. But geologists were not long in seeing that the
boulder formation was characteristic of high latitudes, and that on
the whole the size and number of erratic blocks increases</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 168">[ 168 ]</a></p>

<p>as we travel towards the Arctic regions. They could not fail to
be struck with the contrast which the countries bordering the
Baltic presented when compared with those surrounding the
Mediterranean. The multitude of travelled blocks and striated rocks
in the one region, and the absence of such appearances in the
other, were too obvious to be overlooked. Even the great
development of the boulder formation, with large erratics so far
south as the Alps, offered an exception to the general rule
favourable to the hypothesis that there was some intimate
connection between it and accumulations of snow and ice.</p>

<p><b>Transporting and abrading Power of
Glaciers.</b>&mdash;I have described elsewhere (&ldquo;Principles&rdquo;
vol. i, chap. xvi, 1867) the manner in which the snow of the Alpine
heights is prevented from accumulating indefinitely in thickness by
the constant descent of a large portion of it by gravitation.
Becoming converted into ice it forms what are termed glaciers,
which glide down the principal valleys. On their surface are seen
mounds of rubbish or large heaps of sand and mud, with angular
fragments of rock which fall from the steep slopes or precipices
bounding the glaciers. When a glacier,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 169">[ 169 ]</a></p>

<p>thus laden, descends so far as to reach a region about 3500 feet
above the level of the sea, the warmth of the air is such that it
melts rapidly in summer, and all the mud, sand, and pieces of rock
are slowly deposited at its lower end, forming a confused heap of
unstratified rubbish called a <i>moraine</i>, and resembling the
<i>till</i> before described (p. 166).</p>

<p>Besides the blocks thus carried down on the top of the glacier,
many fall through fissures in the ice to the bottom, where some of
them become firmly frozen into the mass, and are pushed along the
base of the glacier, abrading, polishing, and grooving the rocky
floor below, as a diamond cuts glass, or as emery-powder polishes
steel. The stri&aelig; which are made, and the deep grooves which
are scooped out by this action, are rectilinear and parallel to an
extent never seen in those produced on loose stones or rocks, where
shingle is hurried along by a torrent, or by the waves on a
sea-beach. In addition to these polished, striated, and grooved
surfaces of rock, another mark of the former action of a glacier is
the &ldquo;roche moutonnee.&rdquo; Projecting eminences of rock so called have
been smoothed and worn into the shape of flattened domes by the
glacier as it passed over them. They have been traced in the Alps
to great heights above the present glaciers, and to great
horizontal distances beyond them.</p>

<p><b>Alpine Blocks on the
Jura.</b>&mdash;The moraines, erratics, polished surfaces,
domes, and stri&aelig;, above described, are observed in the great
valley of Switzerland, fifty miles broad; and almost everywhere on
the Jura, a chain which lies to the north of this valley. The
average height of the Jura is about one-third that of the Alps, and
it is now entirely destitute of glaciers; yet it presents almost
everywhere similar moraines, and the same polished and grooved
surfaces. The erratics, moreover, which cover it, present a
phenomenon which has astonished and perplexed the geologist for
more than half a century. No conclusion can be more incontestable
than that these angular blocks of granite, gneiss, and other
crystalline formations came from the Alps, and that they have been
brought for a distance of fifty miles and upward across one of the
widest and deepest valleys in the world; so that they are now
lodged on a chain composed of limestone and other formations,
altogether distinct from those of the Alps. Their great size and
angularity, after a journey of so many leagues, has justly excited
wonder; for hundreds of them are as large as cottages; and one in
particular, composed of gneiss, celebrated under the name of Pierre
&agrave; Bot, rests on the side of a hill about 900 feet above the
lake of Neufch&acirc;tel, and is no less than 40 feet in
diameter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 170">[ 170 ]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1821, M. Venetz first announced his opinion that the
Alpine glaciers must formerly have extended far beyond their
present limits, and the proofs appealed to by him in confirmation
of this doctrine were acknowledged by all subsequent observers, and
greatly strengthened by new observations and arguments. M.
Charpentier supposed that when the glaciers extended continuously
from the Alps to the Jura, the former mountains were 2000 or 3000
feet higher than at present. Other writers, on the contrary,
conjectured that the whole country had been submerged, and the
moraines and erratic blocks transported on floating icebergs; but a
careful study of the distribution of the travelled masses, and the
total absence of marine shells from the old glacial drift of
Switzerland, have entirely disproved this last hypothesis. In
addition to the many evidences of the action of ice in the northern
parts of Europe which we have already mentioned, there occur here
and there in some of these countries, what are wanting in
Switzerland, deposits of marine fossil shells, which exhibit so
arctic a character that they must have led the geologist to infer
the former prevalence of a much colder climate, even had he not
encountered so many accompanying signs of ice-action. The same
marine shells demonstrate the submergence of large areas in
Scandinavia and the British Isles, during the glacial cold.</p>

<p>A characteristic feature of the deposits under consideration in
all these countries is the occurrence of large erratic blocks, and
sometimes of moraine matter, in situations remote from lofty
mountains, and separated from the nearest points where the parent
rocks appear at the surface by great intervening valleys, or arms
of the sea. We also often observe stri&aelig; and furrows, as in
Norway, Sweden, and Scotland, which deviate from the direction
which they ought to follow if they had been connected with the
present line of drainage, and they, therefore, imply the prevalence
of a very distinct condition of things at the time when the cold
was most intense. The actual state of North Greenland seems to
afford the best explanation of such abnormal glacial markings.</p>

<p><b>Greenland Continental
Ice.</b>&mdash;Greenland is a vast unexplored continent,
buried under one continuous and colossal mass of ice that is always
moving seaward, a very small part of it in an easterly direction,
and all the rest westward, or towards Baffin&rsquo;s Bay. All the minor
ridges and valleys are levelled and concealed under a general
covering of snow, but here and there some steep mountains protrude
abruptly</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 171">[ 171 ]</a></p>

<p>from the icy slope, and a few superficial lines of stones or
moraines are visible at certain seasons, when no snow has fallen
for many months, and when evaporation, promoted by the wind and
sun, has caused much of the upper snow to disappear. The height of
this continent is unknown, but it must be very great, as the most
elevated lands of the outskirts, which are described as
comparatively low, attain altitudes of 4000 to 6000 feet. The icy
slope gradually lowers itself towards the outskirts, and then
terminates abruptly in a mass about 2000 feet in thickness, the
great discharge of ice taking place through certain large friths,
which, at their upper ends, are usually about four miles across.
Down these friths the ice is protruded in huge masses, several
miles wide, which continue their course&mdash;grating along the
rocky bottom like ordinary glaciers long after they have reached
the salt water. When at last they arrive at parts of Baffin&rsquo;s Bay
deep enough to buoy up icebergs from 1000 to 1500 feet in vertical
thickness, broken masses of them float off, carrying with them on
their surface not only fine mud and sand but large stones. These
fragments of rock are often polished and scored on one or more
sides, and as the ice melts, they drop down to the bottom of the
sea, where large quantities of mud are deposited, and this muddy
bottom is inhabited by many mollusca.</p>

<p>Although the direction of the ice-streams in Greenland may
coincide in the main with that which separate glaciers would take
if there were no more ice than there is now in the Swiss Alps, yet
the striation of the surface of the rocks on an ice-clad continent
would, on the whole, vary considerably in its minor details from
that which would be imprinted on rocks constituting a region of
separate glaciers. For where there is a universal covering of ice
there will be a general outward movement from the higher and more
central regions towards the circumference and lower country, and
this movement will be, to a certain extent, independent of the
minor inequalities of hill and valley, when these are all reduced
to one level by the snow. The moving ice may sometimes cross even
at right angles deep narrow ravines, or the crests of buried
ridges, on which last it may afterwards seem strange to detect
glacial stri&aelig; and polishing after the liquefaction of the
snow and ice has taken place.</p>

<p>Rink mentions that in North Greenland powerful springs of clayey
water escape in winter from under the ice, where it descends to
&ldquo;the outskirts,&rdquo; and where, as already stated, it is often 2000
feet thick&mdash;a fact showing how much grinding action is going
on upon the surface of the subjacent</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 172">[ 172 ]</a></p>

<p>rocks. I also learn from Dr. Torell that there are large areas
in the outskirts, now no longer covered with permanent snow or
glaciers, which exhibit on their surface unmistakable signs of
ancient ice-action, so that, vast as is the power now exerted by
ice in Greenland, it must once have operated on a still grander
scale. The land, though now very elevated, may perhaps have been
formerly much higher. It is well-known that the south coast of
Greenland, from latitude 60&deg; to about 70&deg; N., has for the
last four centuries been sinking at the rate of several feet in a
century. By this means a surface of rock, well scored and polished
by ice, is now slowly subsiding beneath the sea, and is becoming
strewed over, as the icebergs melt, with impalpable mud and
smoothed and scratched stones. It is not precisely known how far
north this downward movement extends.</p>

<p><b>Drift carried by
Icebergs.</b>&mdash;An account was given so long ago as the
year 1822, by Scoresby, of icebergs seen by him in the Arctic seas
drifting along in latitudes 69&deg; and 70&deg; N., which rose
above the surface from 100 to 200 feet, and some of which measured
a mile in circumference. Many of them were loaded with beds of
earth and rock, of such thickness that the weight was conjectured
to be from 50,000 to 100,000 tons. A similar transportation of
rocks is known to be in progress in the southern hemisphere, where
boulders included in ice are far more frequent than in the north.
One of these icebergs was encountered in 1839, in mid-ocean, in the
antarctic regions, many hundred miles from any known land, sailing
northward, with a large erratic block firmly frozen into it. Many
of them, carefully measured by the officers of the French exploring
expedition of the Astrolabe, were between 100 and 225 feet high
above water, and from two to five miles in length. Captain
d&rsquo;Urville ascertained one of them which he saw floating in the
Southern Ocean to be 13 miles long and 100 feet high, with walls
perfectly vertical. The submerged portions of such islands must,
according to the weight of ice relatively to sea-water, be from six
to eight times more considerable than the part which is visible, so
that when they are once fairly set in motion, the mechanical force
which they might exert against any obstacle standing in their way
would be prodigious.</p>

<p>We learn, therefore, from a study both of the arctic and
antarctic regions, that a great extent of land may be entirely
covered throughout the whole year by snow and ice, from the summits
of the loftiest mountains to the sea-coast, and may yet send down
angular erratics to the ocean. We may also conclude that such land
will become in the course of</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 173">[ 173 ]</a></p>

<p>ages almost everywhere scored and polished like the rocks which
underlie a glacier. The discharge of ice into the surrounding sea
will take place principally through the main valleys, although
these are hidden from our sight. Erratic blocks and moraine matter
will be dispersed somewhat irregularly after reaching the sea, for
not only will prevailing winds and marine currents govern the
distribution of the drift, but the shape of the submerged area will
have its influence; inasmuch as floating ice, laden with stones,
will pass freely through deep water, while it will run a ground
where there are reefs and shallows. Some icebergs in Baffin&rsquo;s Bay
have been seen stranded on a bottom 1000 or even 1500 feet deep. In
the course of ages such a sea-bed may become densely covered with
transported matter, from which some of the adjoining greater depths
may be free. If, as in West Greenland, the land is slowly sinking,
a large extent of the bottom of the ocean will consist of rock
polished and striated by land-ice, and then overspread by mud and
boulders detached from melting bergs.</p>

<p>The mud, sand, and boulders thus let fall in still water must be
exactly like the moraines of terrestrial glaciers, devoid of
stratification and organic remains. But occasionally, on the outer
side of such packs of stranded bergs, the waves and currents may
cause the detached earthy and stony materials to be sorted
according to size and weight before they reach the bottom, and to
acquire a stratified arrangement.</p>

<p>I have already alluded (p. 172) to the large quantity of ice,
containing great blocks of stone, which is sometimes seen floating
far from land, in the southern or Antarctic seas. After the
emergence, therefore, of such a submarine area, the superficial
detritus will have no necessary relation to the hills, valleys, and
river-plains over which it will be scattered. Many a water-shed may
intervene between the starting-point of each erratic or pebble and
its final resting-place, and the only means of discovering the
country from which it took its departure will consist in a careful
comparison of its mineral or fossil contents with those of the
parent rocks.</p>
