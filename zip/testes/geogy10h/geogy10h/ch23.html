<p><b>Principal Subdivisions of the Carboniferous
Group.</b>&mdash;The next group which we meet with in the
descending order is the Carboniferous, commonly called &ldquo;The
Coal,&rdquo; because it contains many beds of that mineral, in a
more or less pure state, interstratified with sandstones, shales,
and limestones. The coal itself, even in Great Britain and Belgium,
where it is most abundant, constitutes but an insignificant portion
of the whole mass. In South Wales, for example, the thickness of
the coal-bearing strata has been estimated at between 11,000 and
12,000 feet, while the various coal seams, about 80 in number, do
not, according to Professor Phillips, exceed in the aggregate 120
feet.</p>

<p>The Carboniferous formation assumes various characters in
different parts even of the British Islands. It usually comprises
two very distinct members: first, the sedimentary beds, usually
called the Coal-measures, of mixed fresh-water, terrestrial, and
marine origin, often including seams of coal; second, that named in
England the Mountain or Carboniferous Limestone, of purely marine
origin, and made up chiefly of corals, shells, and encrinites, and
resting on shales called the shales of the Mountain Limestone.</p>

<p>In the south-western part of our island, in Somersetshire and
South Wales, the three divisions usually spoken of are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Coal-measures: Strata of shale, sandstone, and grit, from 600
to 12,000 feet thick, with occasional seams of coal.</li>

<li>Millstone grit: A coarse quartzose sandstone passing into a
conglomerate, sometimes used for millstones, with beds of shale;
usually devoid of coal; occasionally above 600 feet thick.</li>

<li>Mountain or Carboniferous Limestone: A calcareous rock
containing marine shells, corals, and encrinites; devoid of coal;
thickness variable, sometimes more than 1500 feet.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the reader will refer to the section in <a href=
"images/fig85.jpg">Fig. 85,</a> he will see that the Upper and
Lower Coal-measures of the coal-field near Bristol are divided by a
micaceous flaggy sandstone called the Pennant Rock. The Lower
Coal-measures of the same section rest sometimes, especially in the
north part of the basin, on a base of coarse grit called the
Millstone Grit (No. 2 on the previous page).</p>

<p>In the South Welsh coal-field Millstone Grit occurs in like
manner at the base of the productive coal. It is called by the
miners the &ldquo;Farewell Rock,&rdquo; as when they reach it they
have no longer any hopes of obtaining coal at a greater depth in
the same district. In the central and northern coal-fields of
England this same grit, including quartz pebbles, with some
accompanying sandstones and shales containing coal plants, acquires
a thickness of several thousand feet, lying beneath the productive
coal-measures, which are nearly 10,000 feet thick.</p>

<p>Below the Millstone Grit is a continuation of similar sandstones
and shales called by Professor Phillips the Yoredale series, from
Yoredale, in Yorkshire, where they attain a thickness of from 800
to 1000 feet. At several intervals bands of limestone divide this
part of the series, one of which, called the Main Limestone or
Upper Scar Limestone, composed in great part of encrinites, is 70
feet thick. Thin seams of coal also occur in these lower Yoredale
beds in Yorkshire, showing that in the same region there were great
alternations in the state of the surface. For at successive periods
in the same area there prevailed first terrestrial conditions
favourable to the growth of pure coal, secondly, a sea of some
depth suited to the formation of Carboniferous Limestone, and,
thirdly, a supply of muddy sediment and sand, furnishing the
materials for sandstone and shale. There is no clear line of
demarkation between the Coal-measures and the Millstone Grit, nor
between the Millstone Grit and underlying Yoredale rocks.</p>

<p>On comparing a series of vertical sections in a north-westerly
direction from Leicestershire and Warwickshire into North
Lancashire, we find, says Mr. Hull, within a distance of 120 miles
an augmentation of the sedimentary materials to the extent of
16,000 feet.</p>

<p>In central England, where the sedimentary beds are reduced to
about 3000 feet in all, the Carboniferous Limestone attains an
enormous thickness, as much as 4000 feet at Ashbourne, near Derby,
according to Mr. Hull&rsquo;s estimate. To a certain extent,
therefore, we may consider the calcareous member of the formation
as having originated simultaneously with the accumulation of the
materials of grit, sandstone, and shale, with seams of coal; just
as strata of mud, sand, and pebbles, several thousand feet thick,
with layers of vegetable matter, are now in the process of
formation in the cypress swamps and delta of the Mississippi, while
coral reefs are forming on the coast of Florida and in the sea of
the Bermuda islands. For we may safely conclude that in the ancient
Carboniferous ocean those marine animals which were limestone
builders were never freely developed in areas where the rivers
poured in fresh water charged with sand or clay; and the limestone
could only become several thousand feet thick in parts of the ocean
which remained perfectly clear for ages.</p>

<p>The calcareous strata of the Scotch coal-fields, those of
Lanarkshire, the Lothians, and Fife, for example, are very
insignificant in thickness when compared to those of England. They
consist of a few beds intercalated between the sandstones and
shales containing coal and ironstone, the combined thickness of all
the limestones amounting to no more than 150 feet. The vegetation
of some of these northern sedimentary beds containing coal may be
older than any of the coal-measures of central and southern
England, as being coeval with the Mountain Limestone of the south.
In Ireland the limestone predominates over the coal-bearing sands
and shales. We may infer the former continuity of several of the
coal-fields in northern and central England, not only from the
abrupt manner in which they are cut off at their outcrop, but from
their remarkable correspondence in the succession and character of
particular beds. But the limited extent to which these strata are
exposed at the surface is not merely owing to their former
denudation, but even in a still greater degree to their having been
largely covered by the New Red Sandstone, as in Cheshire, and here
and there by the Permian strata, as in Durham.</p>

<p>It has long been the opinion of the most eminent geologists that
the coal-fields of Yorkshire and Lancashire were once united, the
upper Coal-measures and the overlying Millstone Grit and Yoredale
rocks having been subsequently removed; but what is remarkable, is
the ancient date now assigned to this denudation, for it seems that
a thickness of no less than</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 397">[ 397 ]</a></p>

<p>10,000 feet of the coal-measures had been carried away before
the deposition even of the lower Permian rocks which were thrown
down upon the already disturbed truncated edges of the
coal-strata.* The carboniferous strata most productive of workable
coal have so often a basin-shaped arrangement that these troughs
have sometimes been supposed to be connected with the original
conformation of the surface upon which the beds were deposited. But
it is now admitted that this structure has been owing to movements
of the earth&rsquo;s crust of upheaval and subsidence, and that the
flexure and inclination of the beds has no connection with the
original geographical configuration of the district.</p>

<br>
 

<center><small>COAL-MEASURES.</small></center>

<p>I shall now treat more particularly of the productive
coal-measures, and their mode of origin and organic remains.</p>

<p><b>Coal formed on Land.</b>&mdash;In South Wales, already
alluded to, where the coal-measures attain a thickness of 12,000
feet, the beds throughout appear to have been formed in water of
moderate depth, during a slow, but perhaps intermittent, depression
of the ground, in a region to which rivers were bringing a
never-failing supply of muddy sediment and sand. The same area was
sometimes covered with vast forests, such as we see in the deltas
of great rivers in warm climates, which are liable to be submerged
beneath fresh or salt water should the ground sink vertically a few
feet.</p>

<p>In one section near Swansea, in South Wales, where the total
thickness of strata is 3246 feet, we learn from Sir H. De la Beche
that there are ten principal masses of sandstone. One of these is
500 feet thick, and the whole of them make together a thickness of
2125 feet. They are separated by masses of shale, varying in
thickness from 10 to 50 feet. The intercalated coal-beds, sixteen
in number, are generally from one to five feet thick, one of them,
which has two or three layers of clay interposed, attaining nine
feet. At other points in the same coal-field the shales predominate
over the sandstones. Great as is the diversity in the horizontal
extent of individual coal-seams, they all present one
characteristic feature, in having, each of them, what is called its
<i>underclay.</i> These underclays, co-extensive with every layer
of coal, consist of arenaceous shale, sometimes called fire-stone,
because it can be made into bricks which stand the fire of a
furnace. They vary in thickness from six inches to more than ten
feet; and Sir William Logan first announced to the scientific world
in 1841 that they were regarded by the colliers in South</p>

<p class="fnote">* Edward Hull, Quart. Geol. Journ., vol. xxiv, p.
327.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 398">[ 398 ]</a></p>

<p>Wales as an essential accompaniment of each of the eighty or
more seams of coal met with in their coal-field. They are said to
form the <i>floor</i> on which the coal rests; and some of them
have a slight admixture of carbonaceous matter, while others are
quite blackened by it.</p>

<p>All of them, as Sir William Logan pointed out, are characterised
by inclosing a peculiar species of fossil vegetable called <i>
Stigmaria,</i> to the exclusion of other plants. It was also
observed that, while in the overlying shales, or &ldquo;roof&rdquo;
of the coal, ferns and trunks of trees abound without any <i>
Stigmari&aelig;,</i> and are flattened and compressed, those
singular plants of the underclay most commonly retain their natural
forms, unflattened and branching freely, and sending out their
slender rootlets, formerly thought to be leaves, through the mud in
all directions. Several species of <i>Stigmaria</i> had long been
known to botanists, and described by them, before their position
under each seam of coal was pointed out, and before their true
nature as the roots of trees (some having been actually found
attached to the base of <i>Sigillaria</i> stumps) was recognised.
It was conjectured that they might be aquatic, perhaps floating
plants, which sometimes extended their branches and leaves freely
in fluid mud, in which they were finally enveloped.</p>

<p>Now that all agree that these underclays are ancient soils, it
follows that in every instance where we find them they attest the
terrestrial nature of the plants which formed the overlying coal,
which consists of the trunks, branches, and leaves of the same
plants. The trunks have generally fallen prostrate in the coal, but
some of them still remain at right angles to the ancient soils (see
<a href="images32/fig440.jpg">Fig. 440</a>). Professor Goppert,
after examining the fossil vegetables of the coal-fields of
Germany, has detected, in beds of pure coal, remains of plants of
every family hitherto known to occur fossil in the carboniferous
rocks. Many seams, he remarks, are rich in <i>Sigillari&aelig;,
Lepidodendra,</i> and <i>Stigmari&aelig;,</i> the latter in such
abundance as to appear to form the bulk of the coal. In some
places, almost all the plants were calamites, in others ferns.*</p>

<p>Between the years 1837 and 1840, six fossil trees were
discovered in the coal-fields of Lancashire, where it is
intersected by the Bolton railway. They were all at right angles to
the plane of the bed, which dips about 15 degrees to the south. The
distance between the first and the last was more than 100 feet, and
the roots of all were imbedded in a soft argillaceous shale. In the
same plane with the roots is a bed of</p>

<p class="fnote">* Quart. Geol. Journ., vol. v, Mem., p. 17.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 399">[ 399 ]</a></p>

<p>coal, eight or ten inches thick, which has been found to extend
across the railway, or to the distance of at least ten yards. Just
above the covering of the roots, yet beneath the coal-seam, so
large a quantity of the <i>Lepidostrobus variabilis</i> was
discovered inclosed in nodules of hard clay, that more than a
bushel was collected from the small openings around the base of
some of the trees (see <a href="images3/fig457.jpg">Fig. 457</a> of
this genus). The exterior trunk of each was marked by a coating of
friable coal, varying from one-quarter to three-quarters of an inch
in thickness; but it crumbled away on removing the matrix. The
dimensions of one of the trees is 15&frac12; feet in circumference
at the base, 7&frac12; feet at the top, its height being eleven
feet. All the trees have large spreading roots, solid and strong,
sometimes branching, and traced to a distance of several feet, and
presumed to extend much farther.</p>

<p>In a colliery near Newcastle a great number of <i>
Sigillari&aelig;</i> occur in the rock as if they had retained the
position in which they grew. No less than thirty, some of them four
or five feet in diameter, were visible within an area of 50 yards
square, the interior being sandstone, and the bark having been
converted into coal. Such vertical stems are familiar to our
coal-miners, under the name of coal-pipes. They are much dreaded,
for almost every year in the Bristol, Newcastle, and other
coal-fields, they are the cause of fatal accidents. Each
cylindrical cast of a tree, formed of solid sandstone, and
increasing gradually in size towards the base, and being without
branches, has its whole weight thrown downward, and receives no
support from the coating of friable coal which has replaced the
bark. As soon, therefore, as the cohesion of this external layer is
overcome, the heavy column falls suddenly in a perpendicular or
oblique direction from the roof of the gallery whence coal has been
extracted, wounding or killing the workman who stands below. It is
strange to reflect how many thousands of these trees fell
originally in their native forests in obedience to the law of
gravity; and how the few which continued to stand erect, obeying,
after myriads of ages, the same force, are cast down to immolate
their human victims.</p>

<p>It has been remarked that if, instead of working in the dark,
the miner was accustomed to remove the upper covering of rock from
each seam of coal, and to expose to the day the soils on which
ancient forests grew, the evidence of their former growth would be
obvious. Thus in South Staffordshire a seam of coal was laid bare
in the year 1844, in what is called an open work at Parkfield
colliery, near Wolverhampton. In the space of about a quarter of an
acre the</p>

"Fig. 429: Ground plan of fossil forest, Parkfield Colliery, near Wolverhampton, showing the position of 73 trees in a quarter of an ace."
 align="left"> 

<p>stumps of no less than 73 trees with their roots attached
appeared, as shown in Fig. 429, some of them more than eight feet
in circumference. The trunks, broken off close to the root, were
lying prostrate in every direction, often crossing each other. One
of them measured 15, another 30 feet in length, and others less.
They were invariably flattened to the thickness of one or two
inches, and converted into coal. Their roots formed part of a
stratum of coal ten inches thick, which rested on a layer of clay
two inches thick, below which was a second forest resting on a
two-foot seam of coal. Five feet below this, again, was a third
forest with large stumps of <i>Lepidodendra, Calamites,</i> and
other trees.</p>

<p><b>Blending of Coal-seams.</b>&mdash;Both in England and North
America seams of coal are occasionally observed to be parted from
each other by layers of clay and sand, and, after they have been
persistent for miles, to come together and blend in one single bed,
which is then found to be equal in the aggregate to the thickness
of the several seams. I was shown by Mr. H. D. Rogers a remarkable
example of this in Pennsylvania. In the Shark Mountain, near
Pottsville, in that State, there are thirteen seams of anthracite
coal, some of them more than six feet thick, separated by beds of
white quartzose grit and a conglomerate of quartz pebbles, often of
the size of a hen&rsquo;s egg. Between Pottsville and the Lehigh
Summit Mine, seven of these seams of coal, at first widely
separated, are, in the course of several miles, brought nearer and
nearer together by the gradual thinning out of the intervening
coarse-grained strata and their accompanying shales, until at
length they successively unite and form one mass of coal between
forty and fifty feet thick, very pure on the whole, though with a
few thin partings of clay. This mass of coal I saw quarried in the
open air at Mauch</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 401">[ 401 ]</a></p>

<p>Chunk, on the Bear Mountain. The origin of such a vast thickness
of vegetable remains, so unmixed, on the whole, with earthy
ingredients, can be accounted for in no other way than by the
growth, during thousands of years, of trees and ferns in the manner
of peat&mdash;a theory which the presence of the Stigmaria <i>in
situ</i> under each of the seven layers of anthracite fully bears
out. The rival hypothesis, of the drifting of plants into a sea or
estuary, leaves the non-intermixture of sediment, or of clay, sand,
and pebbles, with the pure coal wholly unexplained.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Bowman was the first who gave a satisfactory
explanation of the manner in which distinct coal-seams, after
maintaining their independence for miles, may at length unite, and
then persist throughout another wide area with a thickness equal to
that which the separate seams had previously maintained.</p>

<center><img src="images3/fig430.jpg" width="396" height="97" alt=
"Fig. 430: Uniting of distinct coal-seams."></center>

<p>Let A C (Fig. 430) be a three-foot seam of coal originally laid
down as a mass of vegetable matter on the level area of an
extensive swamp, having an under-clay, <i>f g,</i> through which
the Stigmari&aelig; or roots of the trees penetrate as usual. One
portion, B C, of this seam of coal is now inclined; the area of the
swamp having subsided as much as 25 feet at E C, and become for a
time submerged under salt, fresh, or brackish water. Some of the
trees of the original forest A B C fell down, others continued to
stand erect in the new lagoon, their stumps and part of their
trunks becoming gradually enveloped in layers of sand and mud,
which at length filled up the new piece of water C E.</p>

<p>When this lagoon has been entirely silted up and converted into
land, the forest-covered surface A B will extend once more over the
whole area A B E, and a second mass of vegetable matter, D E,
forming three feet more of coal, will accumulate. We then find in
the region E C two seams of coals, each three feet thick, with
their respective under-clays, with erect buried trees based upon
the surface of the lower coal, the two seams being separated by 25
feet of intervening shale and sandstone. Whereas in the region A B,
where the growth of the forest has never been interrupted by
submergence, there will simply be one seam, two yards thick,
corresponding to the united thickness of the beds B E and</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 402">[ 402 ]</a></p>

<p>B C. It may be objected that the uninterrupted growth of plants
during the interval of time required for the filling up of the
lagoon will have caused the vegetable matter in the region D A B to
be thicker than the two distinct seams E and C, and no doubt there
would actually be a slight excess representing one or more
generation of trees and plants forming the undergrowth; but this
excess of vegetable matter, when compressed into coal, would be so
insignificant in thickness that the miner might still affirm that
the seam D A throughout the area D A B was equal to the two seams C
and E.</p>

<p><b>Cause of the Purity of Coal.</b>&mdash;The purity of the coal
itself, or the absence in it of earthy particles and sand,
throughout areas of vast extent, is a fact which appears very
difficult to explain when we attribute each coal-seam to a
vegetation growing in swamps. It has been asked how, during river
inundations capable of sweeping away the leaves of ferns and the
stems and roots of <i>Sigillari&aelig;</i> and other trees, could
the waters fail to transport some fine mud into the swamps? One
generation after another of tall trees grew with their roots in
mud, and their leaves and prostrate trunks formed layers of
vegetable matter, which was afterwards covered with mud since
turned to shale. Yet the coal itself, or altered vegetable matter,
remained all the while unsoiled by earthy particles. This enigma,
however perplexing at first sight, may, I think, be solved by
attending to what is now taking place in deltas. The dense growth
of reeds and herbage which encompasses the margins of
forest-covered swamps in the valley and delta of the Mississippi is
such that the fluviatile waters, in passing through them, are
filtered and made to clear themselves entirely before they reach
the areas in which vegetable matter may accumulate for centuries,
forming coal if the climate be favourable. There is no possibility
of the least intermixture of earthy matter in such cases. Thus in
the large submerged tract called the &ldquo;Sunk Country,&rdquo;
near New Madrid, forming part of the western side of the valley of
the Mississippi, erect trees have been standing ever since the year
1811-12, killed by the great earthquake of that date; lacustrine
and swamp plants have been growing there in the shallows, and
several rivers have annually inundated the whole space, and yet
have been unable to carry in any sediment within the outer
boundaries of the morass, so dense is the marginal belt of reeds
and brush-wood. It may be affirmed that generally, in the
&ldquo;cypress swamps&rdquo; of the Mississippi, no sediment
mingles with the vegetable matter accumulated there from the decay
of trees and semi-aquatic plants. As a singular proof of this</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 403">[ 403 ]</a></p>

<p>fact, I may mention that whenever any part of a swamp in
Louisiana is dried up, during an unusually hot season, and the wood
set on fire, pits are burnt into the ground many feet deep, or as
far down as the fire can descend without meeting with water, and it
is then found that scarcely any residuum or earthy matter is left.
At the bottom of all these &ldquo;cypress swamps&rdquo; a bed of
clay is found, with roots of the tall cypress (<i>Taxodium
distichum</i>), just as the under-clays of the coal are filled with
<i>Stigmaria.</i></p>

<p><b>Conversion of Coal into Anthracite.</b>&mdash;It appears from
the researches of Liebig and other eminent chemists, that when wood
and vegetable matter are buried in the earth exposed to moisture,
and partially or entirely excluded from the air, they decompose
slowly and evolve carbonic acid gas, thus parting with a portion of
their original oxygen. By this means they become gradually
converted into lignite or wood-coal, which contains a larger
proportion of hydrogen than wood does. A continuance of
decomposition changes this lignite into common or bituminous coal,
chiefly by the discharge of carbureted hydrogen, or the gas by
which we illuminate our streets and houses. According to Bischoff,
the inflammable gases which are always escaping from mineral coal,
and are so often the cause of fatal accidents in mines, always
contain carbonic acid, carbureted hydrogen, nitrogen, and olefiant
gas. The disengagement of all these gradually transforms ordinary
or bituminous coal into anthracite, to which the various names of
glance-coal, coke, hard-coal, culm, and many others, have been
given.</p>

<p>There is an intimate connection between the extent to which the
coal has in different regions parted with its gaseous contents, and
the amount of disturbance which the strata have undergone. The
coincidence of these phenomena may be attributed partly to the
greater facility afforded for the escape of volatile matter, when
the fracturing of the rocks has produced an infinite number of
cracks and crevices. The gases and water which are made to
penetrate these cracks are probably rendered the more effective as
metamorphic agents by increased temperature derived from the
interior. It is well known that, at the present period, thermal
waters and hot vapours burst out from the earth during earthquakes,
and these would not fail to promote the disengagement of volatile
matter from the Carboniferous rocks.</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania the strata of coal are horizontal to the
westward of the Alleghany Mountains, where the late Professor H. D.
Rogers pointed out that they were most</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 404">[ 404 ]</a></p>

<p>bituminous; but as we travel south-eastward, where they no
longer remain level and unbroken, the same seams become
progressively debitumenized in proportion as the rocks become more
bent and distorted. At first, on the Ohio River, the proportion of
hydrogen, oxygen, and other volatile matters ranges from forty to
fifty per cent. Eastward of this line, on the Monongahela, it still
approaches forty per cent, where the strata begin to experience
some gentle flexures. On entering the Alleghany Mountains, where
the distinct anticlinal axes begin to show themselves, but before
the dislocations are considerable, the volatile matter is generally
in the proportion of eighteen or twenty per cent. At length, when
we arrive at some insulated coal-fields associated with the boldest
flexures of the Appalachian chain, where the strata have been
actually turned over, as near Pottsville, we find the coal to
contain only from six per cent of volatile matter, thus becoming a
genuine anthracite.</p>

<p><b>Clay-ironstone.</b>&mdash;Bands and nodules of clay-ironstone
are common in coal-measures, and are formed, says Sir H. De la
Beche, of carbonate of iron mingled mechanically with earthy
matter, like that constituting the shales. Mr. Hunt, of the Museum
of Practical Geology, instituted a series of experiments to
illustrate the production of this substance, and found that
decomposing vegetable matter, such as would be distributed through
all coal strata, prevented the further oxidation of the proto-salts
of iron, and converted the peroxide into protoxide by taking a
portion of its oxygen to form carbonic acid. Such carbonic acid,
meeting with the protoxide of iron in solution, would unite with it
and form a carbonate of iron; and this mingling with fine mud, when
the excess of carbonic acid was removed, might form beds or nodules
of argillaceous ironstone.*</p>

<p><b>Intercalated Marine Beds in Coal.</b>&mdash;Both in the
coal-fields of Europe and America the association of fresh,
brackish-water, and marine strata with coal-seams of terrestrial
origin is frequently recognised. Thus, for example, a deposit near
Shrewsbury, probably formed in brackish water, has been described
by Sir R. Murchison as the youngest member of the coal-measures of
that district, at the point where they are in contact with the
overlying Permian group. It consists of shales and sandstones about
150 feet thick, with coal and traces of plants; including a bed of
limestone varying from two to nine feet in thickness, which is
cellular, and resembles some lacustrine limestones of France and
Germany. It has been traced for 30 miles in a straight line, and
can be recognised</p>

coal-measures of Bohemia, and about the same time in those of
Coalbrook Dale by Mr. Prestwich, were also true insects, such as

<p>of the cockroach or <i>Blatta</i> family, and the wing of a

Goldenberg published, in 1854, descriptions of no less than twelve
species of insects from the nodular clay-ironstone of
Saarbr&uuml;ck, near Tr&egrave;ves.* Among them are several <i>

of the <i>Scarab&aelig;us</i> family, a grasshopper or locust, <i>

Professor Goldenberg showed me, in 1864, the wing of a white ant,
found low down in the productive coal-measures of Saarbr&uuml;ck,
in the interior of a flattened Lepidodendron. It is much larger
than that of any known living species of the same genus.</p>

<p><b>Batrachian Reptiles in Coal.</b>&mdash;No vertebrated animals
more highly organised than fish were known in rocks of higher
antiquity than the Permian until the year 1844, when the <i>Apateon
pedestris,</i> Meyer, was discovered in the coal-measures of
Munster-Appel in Rhenish Bavaria, and three years later, in 1847,
Professor von Dechen found three other distinct species of the same
family of Amphibia in the Saarbruck coal-field above alluded to.
These were described by the late Professor Goldfuss under the
generic name of <i>Archegosaurus.</i> The skulls, teeth, and the
greater portions of the skeleton, nay, even a large part of the
skin, of two of these reptiles have been faithfully preserved in
the centre of spheroidal concretions of clay-ironstone. The largest
of these, <i>Archegosaurus Decheni,</i> must</p>

<p>have been three feet six inches long. Figure 436 represents the
skull and neck bones of the smallest of the three, of the natural
size. They were considered by Goldfuss as saurians, but by Herman
von Meyer as most nearly allied to the <i>Labyrinthodon</i> before
mentioned (<a href="ch21.html#page 371">p. 371</a>), and the
remains of the extremities leave no doubt they were quadrupeds,
&ldquo;provided,&rdquo; says Von Meyer, &ldquo;with hands and feet
terminating in distinct toes; but these limbs were weak, serving
only for swimming or creeping.&rdquo; The same anatomist has
pointed out certain points of analogy between their bones and those
of the <i>Proteus anguinus</i>; and Professor Owen has observed
that they make an approach to the <i>Proteus</i> in the shortness
of their ribs. Two specimens of these ancient reptiles retain a
large part of the outer skin, which consisted of long, narrow,
wedge-shaped, tile-like, and horny scales, arranged in rows (see
Fig. 437).</p>

<p>In 1865, several species belonging to three different genera of
the same family of perennibranchiate Batrachians were found in the
coal-field of Kilkenny in bituminous shale at the junction of the
coal with the underlying Stigmaria-bearing clay. They were,
probably, inhabitants of a marsh, and the large processes
projecting from the vertebr&aelig; of their tail imply, according
to Professor Huxley, great powers of swimming. They were of the
Labyrinthodont family, and their association with the fish of the
coal, of which so large a proportion are ganoids, reminds us that
the living perennibranchiate amphibia of America frequent the same
rivers as the ganoid Lepidostei or bony pikes.</p>

<p><i>Labyrinthodont footprints in coal-measures.</i>&mdash;In
1844, the very year when the Apateon, before mentioned, of the coal
was first met with in the country between the Moselle and the
Rhine, Dr. King published an account of the footprints of a large
reptile discovered by him in North America. These occur in the
coal-strata of Greensburg, in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania;
and I had an opportunity of examining them when in that country in
1846. The footmarks were first observed standing out in relief from
the lower surface of slabs of sandstone, resting on thin layers of
fine unctuous clay. I brought away one of these masses, which is
represented in Fig. 438. It displays, together with footprints, the
casts of cracks (<i>a, a'</i>) of various sizes. The origin of such
cracks in</p>

</center>

<p>clay, and casts of the same, has before been explained, and
referred to the drying and shrinking of mud, and the subsequent
pouring of sand into open crevices. It will be seen that some of
the cracks, as at <i>b, c,</i> traverse the footprints, and produce
distortion in them, as might have been expected, for the mud must
have been soft when the animal walked over it and left the
impressions; whereas, when it afterwards dried up and shrank, it
would be too hard to receive such indentations.</p>

<p>We may assume that the reptile which left these prints</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 409">[ 409 ]</a></p>

<p>on the ancient sands of the coal-measures was an air-breather,
because its weight would not have been sufficient under water to
have made impressions so deep and distinct. The same conclusion is
also borne out by the casts of the cracks above described, for they
show that the clay had been exposed to the air and sun, so as to
have dried and shrunk.</p>

<p><b>Nova Scotia Coal-measures.</b>&mdash;The sedimentary strata
in which thin seams of coal occur attain a thickness, as we have
seen, of 18,000 feet in the north of England exclusive of the
Mountain Limestone, and are estimated by Von Dechen at over 20,000
feet in Rhenish Prussia. But the finest example in the world of a
natural exposure in a continuous section ten miles long, occurs in
the sea-cliffs bordering a branch of the Bay of Fundy, in Nova
Scotia. These cliffs, called the &ldquo;South Joggins,&rdquo; which
I first examined in 1842, and afterwards with Dr. Dawson in 1845,
have lately been admirably described by the last-mentioned
geologist* in detail, and his evidence is most valuable as showing
how large a portion of this dense mass was formed on land, or in
swamps where terrestrial vegetation flourished, or in fresh-water
lagoons. His computation of the thickness of the whole series of
carboniferous strata as exceeding three miles, agrees with the
measurement made independently by Sir William Logan in his survey
of this coast.</p>

<p>There is no reason to believe that in this vast succession of
strata, comprising some marine as well as many fresh-water and
terrestrial formations, there is any repetition of the same beds.
There are no faults to mislead the geologist, and cause him to
count the same beds over more than once, while some of the same
plants have been traced from the top to the bottom of the whole
series, and are distinct from the flora of the antecedent Devonian
formation of Canada. Eighty-one seams of coal, varying in thickness
from an inch to about five feet, have been discovered, and no less
than seventy-one of these have been actually exposed in the
sea-cliffs.</p>

<p>In the section (Fig. 439), which I examined in 1842, the beds
from <i>c</i> to <i>i</i> are seen all dipping the same way, their
average inclination being at an angle of 24&deg; S.S.W. The
vertical height of the cliffs is from 150 to 200 feet; and between
<i>d</i> and <i>g</i>&mdash;in which space I observed seventeen
trees in an upright position, or, to speak more correctly, at right
angles to the planes of stratification&mdash;I counted nineteen
seams of coal, varying in thickness from two inches to four feet.
At low tide a fine horizontal section of the same beds is exposed
to view on the beach, which at low tide extends sometimes 200</p>

<p>yards from the base of the cliff. The thickness of the beds
alluded to, between <i>d</i> and <i>g,</i> is about 2500 feet, the
erect trees consisting chiefly of large <i>Sigillari&aelig;,</i>
occurring at ten distinct levels, one above the other. The usual
height of the buried trees seen by me was from six to eight feet;
but one trunk was about 25 feet high and four feet in diameter,
with a considerable bulge at the base. In no instance could I
detect any trunk intersecting a layer of coal, however thin; and
most of the trees terminated downward in seams of coal. Some few
only were based on clay and shale; none of them, except <i>
Calamites,</i> on sandstone. The erect trees, therefore, appeared
in general to have grown on beds of vegetable matter. In the
underclays <i>Stigmaria</i> abounds.</p>

<center><img src="images3/fig439.jpg" width="394" height="142" alt=
"Fig. 439: Section of the cliffs of the South Joggins, near Minudie, Nova Scotia.">
</center>

<p>These root-bearing beds have been found under all the
coal-seams, and such old soils are at present the most destructible
masses in the whole cliff, the sandstones and laminated shales
being harder and more capable of resisting the action of the waves
and the weather. Originally the reverse was doubtless true, for in
the existing delta of the Mississippi those clays in which the
innumerable roots of the deciduous cypress and other swamp trees
ramify in all directions are seen to withstand far more effectually
the undermining power of the river, or of the sea at the base of
the delta, than do beds of loose sand or layers of mud not
supporting trees. It is obvious that if this sand or mud be
afterwards consolidated and turned to sandstone and hard shale, it
would be the least destructible.</p>

<p>In regard to the plants, they belonged to the same genera, and
most of them to the same species, as those met with in the distant
coal-fields of Europe. Dr. Dawson has enumerated more than 150
species, two-thirds of which are European, a greater agreement than
can be said to exist between the same Nova Scotia flora and that of
the coal-fields of the United States. By referring to the section,
Fig. 439, the position of the four-foot coal will be perceived, and
in Fig. 440 (a section made by me in 1842 of a small portion) that
from <i>e</i> to <i>f</i></p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 411">[ 411 ]</a></p>

<p>of the same cliff is exhibited, in order to show the manner of
occurrence of erect fossil trees at right angles to the planes of
the inclined strata.</p>

<img src="images3/fig440.jpg" width="284" height="207" alt=
"Fig. 440: Erect fossil trees, Coal-measures, Nova Scotia." align=
"right"> 

<p>In the sandstone which filled their interiors, I frequently
observed fern-leaves, and sometimes fragments of <i>Stigmaria,</i>
which had evidently entered together with sediment after the trunk
had decayed and become hollow, and while it was still standing
under water. Thus the tree, <i>a,</i> Fig. 440, represented in the
bed <i>e</i> in the section, Fig. 439, is a hollow trunk five feet
eight inches in length, traversing various strata, and cut off at
the top by a layer of clay two feet thick, on which rests a seam of
coal (<i>b,</i> Fig. 440) one foot thick. On this coal again stood
two large trees (<i>c</i> and <i>d</i>), while at a greater height
the trees <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> rest upon a thin seam of coal
(<i>e</i>), and above them is an underclay, supporting the
four-foot coal.</p>

<p>Occasionally the layers of matter in the inside of the tree are
more numerous than those without; but it is more common in the
coal-measures of all countries to find a cylinder of pure
sandstone&mdash;the cast of the interior of a
tree&mdash;intersecting a great many alternating beds of shale and
sandstone, which originally enveloped the trunk as it stood erect
in the water. Such a want of correspondence in the materials
outside and inside, is just what we might expect if we reflect on
the difference of time at which the deposition of sediment will
take place in the two cases; the imbedding of the tree having gone
on for many years before its decay had made much progress. In many
places distinct proof is seen that the enveloping strata took years
to accumulate, for some of the sandstones surrounding erect
sigillarian trunks support at different levels roots and stems of
<i>Calamites</i>; the <i>Calamites</i> having begun to grow after
the older <i>Sigillari&aelig;</i> had been partially buried.</p>

<p>The general absence of structure in the interior of the large
fossil trees of the Coal implies the very durable nature of their
bark, as compared with their woody portion. The</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 412">[ 412 ]</a></p>

<p>same difference of durability of bark and wood exists in modern
trees, and was first pointed out to me by Dr. Dawson, in the
forests of Nova Scotia, where the Canoe Birch (<i>Betula
papyracea</i>) has such tough bark that it may sometimes be seen in
the swamps looking externally sound and fresh, although consisting
simply of a hollow cylinder with all the wood decayed and gone.
When portions of such trunks have become submerged in the swamps
they are sometimes found filled with mud. One of the erect fossil
trees of the South Joggins fifteen feet in height, occurring at a
higher level than the main coal, has been shown by Dr. Dawson to
have a coniferous structure, so that some <i>Conifer&aelig;</i> of
the Coal period grew in the same swamps as <i>Sigillari&aelig;,</i>
just as now the deciduous Cypress (<i>Taxodium distichum</i>)
abounds in the marshes of Louisiana even to the edge of the
sea.</p>

<p>When the carboniferous forests sank below high-water mark, a
species of <i>Spirorbis</i> or <i>Serpula</i> (<a href=
"images3/fig431.jpg">Fig. 431</a>), attached itself to the outside
of the stumps and stems of the erect trees, adhering occasionally
even to the interior of the bark&mdash;another proof that the
process of envelopment was very gradual. These hollow upright
trees, covered with innumerable marine annelids, reminded me of a
&ldquo;cane-brake,&rdquo; as it is commonly called, consisting of
tall reeds, <i>Arundinaria macrosperma,</i> which I saw in 1846, at
the Balize, or extremity of the delta of the Mississippi. Although
these reeds are fresh-water plants, they were covered with
barnacles, having been killed by an incursion of salt-water over an
extent of many acres, where the sea had for a season usurped a
space previously gained from it by the river. Yet the dead reeds,
in spite of this change, remained standing in the soft mud,
enabling us to conceive how easily the larger <i>
Sigillari&aelig;,</i> hollow as they were but supported by strong
roots, may have resisted an incursion of the sea.</p>

<p>The high tides of the Bay of Fundy, rising more than 60 feet,
are so destructive as to undermine and sweep away continually the
whole face of the cliffs, and thus a new crop of erect fossil trees
is brought into view every three or four years. They are known to
extend over a space between two and three miles from north to
south, and more than twice that distance from east to west, being
seen in the banks of streams intersecting the coal-field.</p>

<p><i>Structure of Coal.</i>&mdash;The bituminous coal of Nova
Scotia is similar in composition and structure to that of Great
Britain, being chiefly derived from sigillarioid trees mixed with
leaves of ferns and of a Lycopodiaceous tree called <i>
Cordaites</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 413">[ 413 ]</a></p>

<p>(<i>Noeggerathia,</i> etc., for genus, see <a href=
"images3/fig428.jpg">Fig. 428</a>), supposed by Dawson to have been
deciduous, and which had broad parallel veined leaves without a
mid-rib. On the surface of the seams of coal are large quantities
of mineral charcoal, which doubtless consist, as Dr. Dawson
suggests, of fragments of wood which decayed in the open air, as
would naturally be expected in swamps where so many erect trees
were preserved. Beds of cannel-coal display, says Dr. Dawson, such
a microscopical structure and chemical composition as shows them to
have been of the nature of fine vegetable mud such as accumulates
in the shallow ponds of modern swamps. The underclays are loamy
soils, which must have been sufficiently above water to admit of
drainage, and the absence of sulphurets, and the occurrence of
carbonate of iron in them, prove that when they existed as soils,
rain-water, and not sea-water, percolated them. With the exception,
perhaps, of <i>Asterophyllites</i> (see <a href=
"images3/fig460.jpg">Fig. 461</a>), there is a remarkable absence
from the coal-measures of any form of vegetation properly aquatic,
the true coal being a sub-a&euml;rial accumulation in soil that was
wet and swampy but not permanently submerged.</p>

<p><b>Air-breathers of the Coal.</b>&mdash;If we have rightly
interpreted the evidence of the former existence at more than
eighty different levels of forests of trees, some of them of vast
extent, and which lasted for ages, giving rise to a great
accumulation of vegetable matter, it is natural to ask whether
there were not many air-breathing inhabitants of these same
regions. As yet no remains of mammalia or birds have been found, a
negative character common at present to all the Pal&aelig;ozoic
formations; but in 1852 the osseous remains of a reptile, the first
ever met with in the carboniferous strata of the American
continent, were found by Dr. Dawson and myself. We detected them in
the interior of one of the erect Sigillari&aelig; before alluded to
as of such frequent occurrence in Nova Scotia. The tree was about
two feet in diameter, and consisted of an external cylinder of
bark, converted into coal, and an internal stony axis of black
sandstone, or rather mud and sand stained black by carbonaceous
matter, and cemented together with fragments of wood into a rock.
These fragments were in the state of charcoal, and seem to have
fallen to the bottom of the hollow tree while it was rotting away.
The skull, jaws, and vertebr&aelig; of a reptile, probably about
2&frac12; feet in length (<i>Dendrerpeton Acadianum,</i> Owen),
were scattered through this stony matrix. The shell, also, of a <i>
Pupa</i> (see <a href="images3/fig442.jpg">Fig. 442</a>), the first
land-shell ever met with in the coal or in beds older than the
tertiary, was observed in the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 414">[ 414 ]</a></p>

<p>same stony mass. Dr. Wyman of Boston pronounced the reptile to
be allied in structure to <i>Menobranchus</i> and <i>Menopoma,</i>
species of batrachians, now inhabiting the North American rivers.
The same view was afterwards confirmed by Professor Owen, who also
pointed out the resemblance of the cranial plates to those seen in
the skull of <i>Archegosaurus</i> and <i>Labyrinthodon.</i>*
Whether the creature had crept into the hollow tree while its top
was still open to the air, or whether it was washed in with mud
during a flood, or in whatever other manner it entered, must be
matter of conjecture.</p>

<p>Footprints of two reptiles of different sizes had previously
been observed by Dr. Harding and Dr. Gesner on ripple-marked flags
of the lower coal-measures in Nova Scotia (No. 2, <a href=
"images3/fig447.jpg">Fig. 447</a>), evidently made by quadrupeds
walking on the ancient beach, or out of the water, just as the
recent Menopoma is sometimes observed to do. The remains of a
second and smaller species of Dendrerpeton, <i>D. Oweni,</i> were
also found accompanying the larger one, and still retaining some of
its dermal appendages; and in the same tree were the bones of a
third small lizard-like reptile, <i>Hylonomus Lyelli,</i> seven
inches long, with stout hind limbs, and fore limbs comparatively
slender, supposed by Dr. Dawson to be capable of walking and
running on land.&dagger;</p>

<p>In a second specimen of an erect stump of a hollow tree 15
inches in diameter, the ribbed bark of which showed that it was a
Sigillaria, and which belonged to the same forest as the specimen
examined by us in 1852, Dr. Dawson obtained not only fifty
specimens of Pupa vetusta (Fig. 442), and nine skeletons of
reptiles belonging to four species, but also several examples of an
articulated animal resembling the recent centipede or gally-worm, a
creature which feeds on decayed vegetable matter (see Fig. 441).

<p>Some years after the discovery of the first Pupa, Dr. Dawson,
carefully examining the same great section containing so many
buried forests in the cliffs of Nova Scotia, discovered another
bed, separated from the tree containing Dendrerpeton by a mass of
strata more than 1200 feet thick. As there were 21 seams of coal in
this intervening mass, the length of time comprised in the interval
is not to be measured by the mere thickness of the sandstones and
shales. This lower bed is an underclay seven feet thick, with
stigmarian rootlets, and the small land-shells occurring in it are
in all stages of growth. They are chiefly confined to a layer about
two inches thick, and are unmixed with any aquatic shells. They
were all originally entire when imbedded, but are most of them now
crushed, flattened, and distorted by pressure; they must have been
accumulated, says Dr. Dawson, in mud deposited in a pond or
creek.</p>

<p>None of the reptiles obtained from the coal-measures of the
South Joggins are of a higher grade than the Labyrinthodonts, but
some of these were of very great size, two caudal vertebr&aelig;
found by Mr. Marsh in 1862 measuring two and a half inches in
diameter, and implying a gigantic aquatic reptile with a powerful
swimming tail.</p>

<p>Dawson in a coprolite of a terrestrial reptile occurring in a
fossil tree, no specimen of this class has been brought to light in
the Joggins. But Mr. James Barnes found in a bed of shale at Little
Grace Bay, Cape Breton, the wing of an Ephemera, which must have
measured seven inches from tip to tip of the expanded
wings&mdash;larger than any known living insect of the Neuropterous
family.</p>

<p>That we should have made so little progress in obtaining a
knowledge of the terrestrial fauna of the Coal is certainly a
mystery, but we have no reason to wonder at the extreme rarity of
insects, seeing how few are known in the carboniferous rocks of
Europe, worked for centuries before America was discovered, and now
quarried on so enormous a scale. These European rocks have not yet
produced a single land-shell, in spite of the millions of tons of
coal annually extracted, and the many hundreds of soils replete
with the fossil roots of trees, and the erect trunks and stumps
preserved in the position in which they grew. In many large
coal-fields we continue as much in the dark respecting the
invertebrate air-breathers then living, as if the coal had been
thrown down in mid-ocean. The early date of the carboniferous
strata can not explain the enigma, because we know that while the
land supported a luxuriant vegetation, the contemporaneous seas
swarmed with life&mdash;with Articulata, Mollusca, Radiata, and
Fishes. The perplexity in which we are involved when we attempt to
solve this problem may be owing partly to our want of diligence as
collectors, but still more perhaps to ignorance of the laws which
govern the fossilisation of land-animals, whether of high or low
degree.</p>

<p><b>Carboniferous Rain-prints.</b>&mdash;At various levels in the
coal measures of Nova Scotia, ripple-marked sandstones, and shales
with rain-prints, were seen by Dr. Dawson and myself, but still
more perfect impressions of rain were discovered by Mr. Brown, near
Sydney, in the adjoining island of cape Breton. They consist of
very delicate markings on greenish slates, accompanied by
worm-tracks (<i>a, b,</i> Fig. 444), such as are often seen between
high and low water mark on the recent mud of the Bay of Fundy.</p>

<p>The great humidity of the climate of the Coal period had been
previously inferred from the number of its ferns and the continuity
of its forests for hundreds of miles; but it is satisfactory to
have at length obtained such positive proofs of showers of rain,
the drops of which resembled in their average size those which now
fall from the clouds. From such data we may presume that the
atmosphere of the Carboniferous period corresponded in density with
that now investing</p>

<p>the globe, and that different currents of air varied then as now
in temperature, so as to give rise, by their mixture, to the
condensation of aqueous vapour.</p>

<p><b>Folding and Denudation of the Beds indicated by the Nova
Scotia Coal-strata.</b>&mdash;The series of events which are
indicated by the great section of the coal-strata in Nova Scotia
consist of a gradual and long-continued subsidence of a tract which
throughout most of the period was in the state of a delta, though
occasionally submerged beneath a sea of moderate depth. Deposits of
mud and sand were first carried down into a shallow sea on the low
shores of which the footprints of reptiles were sometimes impressed
(see <a href="#page 407">p. 407</a>).</p>

"right"> 

<p>Though no regular seams of coal were formed, the characteristic
imbedded coal-plants are of the genera <i>Cyclopteris</i> and <i>
Alethopteris,</i> agreeing with species occurring at much higher
levels, and distinct from those of the antecedent Devonian group.
The <i>Lepidodendron corrugatum</i> (see Fig. 446), a plant
predominating in the Lower Carboniferous group of Europe, is also
conspicuous in these shallow-water beds, together with many fishes
and entomostracans. A more rapid rate of subsidence sometimes
converted part of the sea into deep clear water, in which there</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 418">[ 418 ]</a></p>

<p>was a growth of coral which was afterwards turned into
crystalline limestone, and parts of it, apparently by the action of
sulphuric acid, into gypsum. In spite of continued sinking,
amounting to several thousand feet, the sea might in time have been
rendered shallow by the growth of coral, had not its conversion
into land or swampy ground been accelerated by the pouring in of
sand and the advance of the delta accompanied with such fluviatile
and brackish-water formations as are common in lagoons.</p>

<p>The amount to which the bed of the sea sank down in order to
allow of the formation of so vast a thickness of rock of
sedimentary and organic origin is expressed by the total thickness
of the Carboniferous strata, including the coal-measures, No. 1,
and the rocks which underlie them, No. 2, Fig. 447.</p>

</center>

<p>After the strata No. 2 had been elaborated, the conditions
proper to a great delta exclusively prevailed, the subsidence still
continuing so that one forest after another grew and was submerged
until their under-clays with roots, and usually seams of coal, were
left at more than eighty distinct levels. Here and there, also,
deposits bearing testimony to the existence of fresh or
brackish-water lagoons, filled with calcareo-bituminous mud, were
formed. In these beds (<i>h</i> and <i>i,</i> <a href=
"images3/fig439.jpg">Fig. 439</a>) are found fresh-water bivalves
or mussels allied to Anodon, though not identical with that or any
living genus, and called <i>Naiadites carbonarius</i> by Dawson.
They are associated with small entomostracous crustaceans of the
genus Cythere, and scales of small fishes. Occasionally some of the
calamite brakes and forests of Sigillari&aelig; and Conifer&aelig;
were exposed in the flood season, or sometimes, perhaps, by slight
elevatory movements to the denuding action of the river or the
sea.</p>

<p>In order to interpret the great coast section exposed to view on
the shores of the Bay of Fundy, the student must,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 418">[ 418 ]</a></p>

<p>in the first place, understand that the newest or last-mentioned
coal formations would have been the only ones known to us (for they
would have covered all the others), had there not been two great
movements in opposite directions, the first consisting of a general
sinking of three miles, which took place during the Carboniferous
Period, and the second an upheaval of more limited horizontal
extent, by which the anticlinal axis A was formed. That the first
great change of level was one of subsidence is proved by the fact
that there are shallow-water deposits at the base of the
Carboniferous series, or in the lowest beds of No. 2.</p>

<p>Subsequent movements produced in the Nova Scotia and the
adjoining New Brunswick coal-fields the usual anticlinal and
synclinal flexures. In order to follow these, we must survey the
country for about thirty miles round the South Joggins, or the
region where the erect trees described in the foregoing pages are
seen. As we pass along the cliffs for miles in a southerly
direction, the beds containing these fossil trees, which were
mentioned as dipping about 18&deg; south, are less and less
inclined, until they become nearly horizontal in the valley of a
small river called the Shoulie, as ascertained by Dr. Dawson. After
passing this synclinal line the beds begin to dip in an opposite or
north-easterly direction, acquiring a steep dip where they rest
unconformably on the edges of the Upper Silurian strata of the
Cobequid Hills, as shown in Fig. 447. But if we travel northward
towards Minudie from the region of the coal-seams and buried
forests, we find the dip of the coal-strata increasing from an
angle of 18&deg; to one of more than 40&deg;, lower beds being
continually exposed to view until we reach the anticlinal axis A
and see the lower Carboniferous formation, No. 2, at the surface.
The missing rocks removed by denudation are expressed by the faint
lines at A, and thus the student will see that, according to the
principles laid down in the seventh chapter, we are enabled, by the
joint operations of upheaval and denudation, to look, as it were,
about three miles into the interior of the earth without passing
beyond the limits of a single formation.</p>
