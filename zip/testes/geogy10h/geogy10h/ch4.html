<p>Having spoken in the preceding chapters of the characters of
sedimentary formations, both as dependent on the deposition of
inorganic matter and the distribution of fossils, I may next treat
of the consolidation of stratified rocks, and the petrifaction of
imbedded organic remains.</p>

<p><b>Chemical and Mechanical
Deposits.</b>&mdash; A distinction has been made by
geologists between deposits of a mechanical, and those of a
chemical, origin. By the name mechanical are designated beds of
mud, sand, or pebbles produced by the action of running water, also
accumulations of stones and scori&aelig; thrown out by a volcano,
which have fallen into their present place by the force of
gravitation. But the matter which forms a chemical deposit has not
been mechanically suspended in water, but in a state of solution
until separated by chemical action. In this manner carbonate of
lime is occasionally precipitated upon the bottom of lakes in a
solid form, as may be well seen in many parts of Italy, where
mineral springs abound, and where the calcareous stone, called
travertin, is deposited. In these springs the lime is usually held
in solution by an excess of carbonic acid, or by heat if it be a
hot spring, until the water, on issuing from the earth, cools or
loses part of its acid. The calcareous matter then falls down in a
solid state, incrusting shells, fragments of wood and leaves, and
binding them together.</p>

<p>That similar travertin is formed at some points in the bed of
the sea where calcareous springs issue can not be doubted, but as a
general rule the quantity of lime, according to Bischoff, spread
through the waters of the ocean is very small, the free carbonic
acid gas in the same waters being five times as much as is
necessary to keep the lime in a fluid state. Carbonate of lime,
therefore, can rarely be precipitated at the bottom of the sea by
chemical action alone, but</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 61">[ 61 ]</a></p>

<p>must be produced by vital agency as in the case of coral
reefs.</p>

<p>In such reefs, large masses of limestone are formed by the stony
skeletons of zoophytes; and these, together with shells, become
cemented together by carbonate of lime, part of which is probably
furnished to the sea-water by the decomposition of dead corals.
Even shells, of which the animals are still living on these reefs,
are very commonly found to be incrusted over with a hard coating of
limestone.</p>

<p>If sand and pebbles are carried by a river into the sea, and
these are bound together immediately by carbonate of lime, the
deposit may be described as of a mixed origin, partly chemical, and
partly mechanical.</p>

<p>Now, the remarks already made in Chapter II, on the original
horizontality of strata are strictly applicable to mechanical
deposits, and only partially to those of a mixed nature. Such as
are purely chemical may be formed on a very steep slope, or may
even incrust the vertical walls of a fissure, and be of equal
thickness throughout; but such deposits are of small extent, and
for the most part confined to vein-stones.</p>

<p><b>Consolidation of Strata.</b>&mdash;It is chiefly in the case of calcareous rocks that solidification
takes place at the time of deposition. But there are many deposits
in which a cementing process comes into operation long afterwards.
We may sometimes observe, where the water of ferruginous or
calcareous springs has flowed through a bed of sand or gravel, that
iron or carbonate of lime has been deposited in the interstices
between the grains or pebbles, so that in certain places the whole
has been bound together into a stone, the same set of strata
remaining in other parts loose and incoherent.</p>

<p>Proofs of a similar cementing action are seen in a rock at
Kelloway, in Wiltshire. A peculiar band of sandy strata belonging
to the group called Oolite by geologists may be traced through
several counties, the sand being for the most part loose and
unconsolidated, but becoming stony near Kelloway. In this district
there are numerous fossil shells which have decomposed, having for
the most part left only their casts. The calcareous matter hence
derived has evidently served, at some former period, as a cement to
the siliceous grains of sand, and thus a solid sandstone has been
produced. If we take fragments of many other argillaceous grits,
retaining the casts of shells, and plunge them into dilute muriatic
or other acid, we see them immediately changed into common sand and
mud; the cement of lime, derived from the shells, having been
dissolved by the acid.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 62">[ 62 ]</a></p>

<p>Traces of impressions and casts are often extremely faint. In
some loose sands of recent date we meet with shells in so advanced
a stage of decomposition as to crumble into powder when touched. It
is clear that water percolating such strata may soon remove the
calcareous matter of the shell; and unless circumstances cause the
carbonate of lime to be again deposited, the grains of sand will
not be cemented together; in which case no memorial of the fossil
will remain.</p>

<p>In what manner silex and carbonate of lime may become widely
diffused in small quantities through the waters which permeate the
earth&rsquo;s crust will be spoken of presently, when the petrifaction of
fossil bodies is considered; but I may remark here that such waters
are always passing in the case of thermal springs from hotter to
colder parts of the interior of the earth; and, as often as the
temperature of the solvent is lowered, mineral matter has a
tendency to separate from it and solidify. Thus a stony cement is
often supplied to sand, pebbles, or any fragmentary mixture. In
some conglomerates, like the pudding-stone of Hertfordshire (a
Lower Eocene deposit), pebbles of flint and grains of sand are
united by a siliceous cement so firmly, that if a block be
fractured, the rent passes as readily through the pebbles as
through the cement.</p>

<p>It is probable that many strata became solid at the time when
they emerged from the waters in which they were deposited, and when
they first formed a part of the dry land. A well-known fact seems
to confirm this idea: by far the greater number of the stones used
for building and road-making are much softer when first taken from
the quarry than after they have been long exposed to the air; and
these, when once dried, may afterwards be immersed for any length
of time in water without becoming soft again. Hence it is found
desirable to shape the stones which are to be used in architecture
while they are yet soft and wet, and while they contain their
&ldquo;quarry-water,&rdquo;  as it is called; also to break up stone intended
for roads when soft, and then leave it to dry in the air for months
that it may harden. Such induration may perhaps be accounted for by
supposing the water, which penetrates the minutest pores of rocks,
to deposit, on evaporation, carbonate of lime, iron, silex, and
other minerals previously held in solution, and thereby to fill up
the pores partially. These particles, on crystallising, would not
only be themselves deprived of freedom of motion, but would also
bind together other portions of the rock which before were loosely
aggregated. On the same principle wet sand and mud become as hard
as stone when</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 63">[ 63 ]</a></p>

<p>frozen; because one ingredient of the mass, namely, the water,
has crystallised, so as to hold firmly together all the separate
particles of which the loose mud and sand were composed.</p>

<p>Dr. MacCulloch mentions a sandstone in Skye, which may be
moulded like dough when first found; and some simple minerals,
which are rigid and as hard as glass in our cabinets, are often
flexible and soft in their native beds: this is the case with
asbestos, sahlite, tremolite, and chalcedony, and it is reported
also to happen in the case of the beryl.*</p>

<p>The marl recently deposited at the bottom of Lake Superior, in
North America, is soft, and often filled with fresh-water shells;
but if a piece be taken up and dried, it becomes so hard that it
can only be broken by a smart blow of the hammer. If the lake,
therefore, was drained, such a deposit would be found to consist of
strata of marlstone, like that observed in many ancient European
formations, and, like them, containing fresh-water shells.</p>

<p><b>Concretionary
Structure.</b>&mdash;It is probable that some of the
heterogeneous materials which rivers transport to the sea may at
once set under water, like the artificial mixture called pozzolana,
which consists of fine volcanic sand charged with about twenty per
cent of oxide of iron, and the addition of a small quantity of
lime. This substance hardens, and becomes a solid stone in water,
and was used by the Romans in constructing the foundations of
buildings in the sea. Consolidation in such cases is brought about
by the action of chemical affinity on finely comminuted matter
previously suspended in water. After deposition similar particles
seem often to exert a mutual attraction on each other, and
congregate together in particular spots, forming lumps, nodules,
and concretions. Thus in many argillaceous deposits there are
calcareous balls, or spherical concretions, ranged in layers
parallel to the general stratification; an arrangement which took
place after the shale or marl had been thrown down in successive
lamin&aelig;; for these lamin&aelig; are often traceable through
the concretions, remaining parallel to those of the surrounding
unconsolidated rock. (See Fig. 48.) Such nodules of limestone have
often a shell or other foreign body in the centre.</p>

<p>Among the most remarkable examples of concretionary structure
are those described by Professor Sedgwick as</p>

<p class="fnote">* Dr. MacCulloch, Syst. of Geol., vol. i, p.
123.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 64">[ 64 ]</a></p>

<p>abounding in the magnesian limestone of the north of England.
The spherical balls are of various sizes, from that of a pea to a
diameter of several feet, and they have both a concentric and
radiated structure, while at the same time the lamin&aelig; of
original deposition pass uninterruptedly through them. In some
cliffs this limestone resembles a great irregular pile of
cannon-balls. Some of the globular masses have their centre in one
stratum, while a portion of their exterior passes through to the
stratum above or below. Thus the larger spheroid in the section
(Fig. 49) passes from the stratum <i>b</i> upward into <i>a.</i> In
this instance we must suppose the deposition of a series of minor
layers, first forming the stratum <i>b,</i> and afterwards the
incumbent stratum <i>a</i>; then a movement of the particles took
place, and the carbonates of lime and magnesia separated from the
more impure and mixed matter forming the still unconsolidated parts
of the stratum. Crystallisation, beginning at the centre, must have
gone on forming concentric coats around the original nucleus
without interfering with the laminated structure of the rock.</p>

<img src="images/fig49.jpg" width="181" height="201" alt=
"Fig. 49: Spheroidal concretions in magnesian limestone. Fig. 50: Section through strata of grit."
 align="left"> 

<p>When the particles of rocks have been thus rearranged by
chemical forces, it is sometimes difficult or impossible to
ascertain whether certain lines of division are due to original
deposition or to the subsequent aggregation of several particles.
Thus suppose three strata of grit, A, B, C, are charged unequally
with calcareous matter, and that B is the most calcareous. If
consolidation takes place in B, the concretionary action may spread
upward into a part of A, where the carbonate of lime is more
abundant than in the rest; so that a mass, <i>d e f,</i> forming a
portion of the superior stratum, becomes united with B into one
solid mass of stone. The original line of division, <i>d e,</i>
being thus effaced, the line <i>d f</i> would generally be
considered as the surface of the bed B, though not strictly a true
plane of stratification.</p>

<p><b>Pressure and Heat.</b>&mdash;When
sand and mud sink to the bottom of a deep sea, the particles are
not pressed down by the enormous weight of the incumbent ocean; for
the water, which becomes mingled with the sand and mud, resists
pressure with a force equal to that of the column of fluid above.
The same happens in regard to organic remains which are</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 65">[ 65 ]</a></p>

<p>filled with water under great pressure as they sink, otherwise
they would be immediately crushed to pieces and flattened.
Nevertheless, if the materials of a stratum remain in a yielding
state, and do not set or solidify, they will be gradually squeezed
down by the weight of other materials successively heaped upon
them, just as soft clay or loose sand on which a house is built may
give way. By such downward pressure particles of clay, sand, and
marl may become packed into a smaller space, and be made to cohere
together permanently.</p>

<p>Analogous effects of condensation may arise when the solid parts
of the earth&rsquo;s crust are forced in various directions by those
mechanical movements hereafter to be described, by which strata
have been bent, broken, and raised above the level of the sea.
Rocks of more yielding materials must often have been forced
against others previously consolidated, and may thus by compression
have acquired a new structure. A recent discovery may help us to
comprehend how fine sediment derived from the detritus of rocks may
be solidified by mere pressure. The graphite or "black lead&rdquo;  of
commerce having become very scarce, Mr. Brockedon contrived a
method by which the dust of the purer portions of the mineral found
in Borrowdale might be recomposed into a mass as dense and compact
as native graphite. The powder of graphite is first carefully
prepared and freed from air, and placed under a powerful press on a
strong steel die, with air-tight fittings. It is then struck
several blows, each of a power of 1000 tons; after which operation
the powder is so perfectly solidified that it can be cut for
pencils, and exhibits when broken the same texture as native
graphite.</p>

<p>But the action of heat at various depths in the earth is
probably the most powerful of all causes in hardening sedimentary
strata. To this subject I shall refer again when treating of the
metamorphic rocks, and of the slaty and jointed structure.</p>

<p><b>Mineralisation of Organic
Remains.</b>&mdash;The changes which fossil organic bodies
have undergone since they were first imbedded in rocks, throw much
light on the consolidation of strata. Fossil shells in some modern
deposits have been scarcely altered in the course of centuries,
having simply lost a part of their animal matter. But in other
cases the shell has disappeared, and left an impression only of its
exterior, or, secondly, a cast of its interior form, or, thirdly, a
cast of the shell itself, the original matter of which has been
removed. These different forms of fossilisation may easily</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 66">[ 66 ]</a></p>

<center><img src="images/fig51.jpg" width="314" height="197" alt=
"Fig. 51: Phasianella Heddingtonensis. Fig. 52: Pleurotomaria Anglica.">
</center>

<p>be understood if we examine the mud recently thrown out from a
pond or canal in which there are shells. If the mud be
argillaceous, it acquires consistency on drying, and on breaking
open a portion of it we find that each shell has left impressions
of its external form. If we then remove the shell itself, we find
within a solid nucleus of clay, having the form of the interior of
the shell. This form is often very different from that of the outer
shell. Thus a cast such as <i>a,</i> Fig. 51, commonly called a
fossil screw, would never be suspected by an inexperienced
conchologist to be the internal shape of the fossil univalve, <i>
b,</i> Fig. 51. Nor should we have imagined at first sight that the
shell a and the cast <i>b,</i> Fig. 52, belong to one and the same
fossil. The reader will observe, in the last-mentioned figure
(<i>b,</i> Fig. 52), that an empty space shaded dark, which the <i>
shell itself</i> once occupied, now intervenes between the
enveloping stone and the cast of the smooth interior of the whorls.
In such cases the shell has been dissolved and the component
particles removed by water percolating the rock. If the nucleus
were taken out, a hollow mould would remain, on which the external
form of the shell with its tubercles and stri&aelig;, as seen in
<i>a,</i> Fig. 52, would be seen embossed. Now if the space alluded
to between the nucleus and the impression, instead of being left
empty, has been filled up with calcareous spar, flint, pyrites, or
other mineral, we then obtain from the mould an exact cast both of
the external and internal form of the original shell. In this
manner silicified casts of shells have been formed; and if the mud
or sand of the nucleus happen to be incoherent, or soluble in acid,
we can then procure in flint an empty shell, which in shape is the
exact counterpart of the original. This cast may be compared to a
bronze statue, representing merely the superficial form,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 67">[ 67 ]</a></p>

<p>and not the internal organisation; but there is another
description of petrifaction by no means uncommon, and of a much
more wonderful kind, which may be compared to certain anatomical
models in wax, where not only the outward forms and features, but
the nerves, blood-vessels, and other internal organs are also
shown. Thus we find corals, originally calcareous, in which not
only the general shape, but also the minute and complicated
internal organisation is retained in flint.</p>

<img src="images/fig53.jpg" width="137" height="167" alt="Fig. 53: Section of a tree from the coal-measures." align="right"> 

<p>Such a process of petrifaction is still more remarkably
exhibited in fossil wood, in which we often perceive not only the
rings of annual growth, but all the minute vessels and medullary
rays. Many of the minute cells and fibres of plants, and even those
spiral vessels which in the living vegetable can only be discovered
by the microscope, are preserved. Among many instances, I may
mention a fossil tree, seventy-two feet in length, found at
Gosforth, near Newcastle, in sandstone strata associated with coal.
By cutting a transverse slice so thin as to transmit light, and
magnifying it about fifty-five times, the texture, as seen in Fig.
53, is exhibited. A texture equally minute and complicated has been
observed in the wood of large trunks of fossil trees found in the
Craigleith quarry near Edinburgh, where the stone was not in the
slightest degree siliceous, but consisted chiefly of carbonate of
lime, with oxide of iron, alumina, and carbon. The parallel rows of
vessels here seen are the rings of annual growth, but in one part
they are imperfectly preserved, the wood having probably decayed
before the mineralising matter had penetrated to that portion of
the tree.</p>

<p>In attempting to explain the process of petrifaction in such
cases, we may first assume that strata are very generally permeated
by water charged with minute portions of calcareous, siliceous, and
other earths in solution. In what manner they become so impregnated
will be afterwards considered. If an organic substance is exposed
in the open air to the action of the sun and rain, it will in time
putrefy, or be dissolved into its component elements, consisting
usually of oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon. These will
readily be absorbed by the atmosphere or be washed away by rain, so
that all vestiges of the dead animal or plant disappear. But if the
same substances be submerged in water, they decompose more
gradually; and if buried in earth, still more</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 68">[ 68 ]</a></p>

<p>slowly; as in the familiar example of wooden piles or other
buried timber. Now, if as fast as each particle is set free by
putrefaction in a fluid or gaseous state, a particle equally minute
of carbonate of lime, flint, or other mineral, is at hand ready to
be precipitated, we may imagine this inorganic matter to take the
place just before left unoccupied by the organic molecule. In this
manner a cast of the interior of certain vessels may first be
taken, and afterwards the more solid walls of the same may decay
and suffer a like transmutation. Yet when the whole is lapidified,
it may not form one homogeneous mass of stone or metal. Some of the
original ligneous, osseous, or other organic elements may remain
mingled in certain parts, or the lapidifying substance itself may
be differently coloured at different times, or so crystallised as
to reflect light differently, and thus the texture of the original
body may be faithfully exhibited.</p>

<p>The student may perhaps ask whether, on chemical principles, we
have any ground to expect that mineral matter will be thrown down
precisely in those spots where organic decomposition is in
progress? The following curious experiments may serve to illustrate
this point: Professor Goppert of Breslau, with a view of imitating
the natural process of petrifaction, steeped a variety of animal
and vegetable substances in waters, some holding siliceous, others
calcareous, others metallic matter in solution. He found that in
the period of a few weeks, or sometimes even days, the organic
bodies thus immersed were mineralised to a certain extent. Thus,
for example, thin vertical slices of deal, taken from the Scotch
fir (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>), were immersed in a moderately strong
solution of sulphate of iron. When they had been thoroughly soaked
in the liquid for several days they were dried and exposed to a
red-heat until the vegetable matter was burnt up and nothing
remained but an oxide of iron, which was found to have taken the
form of the deal so exactly that casts even of the dotted vessels
peculiar to this family of plants were distinctly visible under the
microscope.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Turner observes, that when mineral matter is in a
&ldquo; nascent state,&rdquo;  that is to say, just liberated from a previous
state of chemical combination, it is most ready to unite with other
matter, and form a new chemical compound. Probably the particles or
atoms just set free are of extreme minuteness, and therefore move
more freely, and are more ready to obey any impulse of chemical
affinity. Whatever be the cause, it clearly follows, as before
stated, that where organic matter newly imbedded in sediment is
decomposing, there will chemical changes take place most
actively.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 69">[ 69 ]</a></p>

<p>An analysis was lately made of the water which was flowing off
from the rich mud deposited by the Hooghly River in the Delta of
the Ganges after the annual inundation. This water was found to be
highly charged with carbonic acid holding lime in solution.* Now if
newly-deposited mud is thus proved to be permeated by mineral
matter in a state of solution, it is not difficult to perceive that
decomposing organic bodies, naturally imbedded in sediment, may as
readily become petrified as the substances artificially immersed by
Professor Goppert in various fluid mixtures.</p>

<p>It is well known that the waters of all springs are more or less
charged with earthy, alkaline, or metallic ingredients derived from
the rocks and mineral veins through which they percolate. Silex is
especially abundant in hot springs, and carbonate of lime is almost
always present in greater or less quantity. The materials for the
petrifaction of organic remains are, therefore, usually at hand in
a state of chemical solution wherever organic remains are imbedded
in new strata.</p>
