<p><b>Classification of the Oolite.</b>&mdash;Immediately below the
Hastings Sands we find in Dorsetshire another remarkable
fresh-water formation, called <i>the Purbeck,</i> because it was
first studied in the sea-cliffs of the peninsula of Purbeck in that
county. These beds are for the most part of fresh-water origin, but
the organic remains of some few intercalated beds are marine, and
show that the Purbeck series has a closer affinity to the Oolitic
group, of which it may be considered as the newest or uppermost
member.</p>

<p>In England generally, and in the greater part of Europe, both
the Wealden and Purbeck beds are wanting, and the marine cretaceous
group is followed immediately, in the descending order, by another
series called the Jurassic. In this term, the formations commonly
designated as &ldquo;the Oolite and Lias&rdquo; are included, both
being found in the Jura Mountains. The Oolite was so named because
in the countries where it was first examined the limestones
belonging to it had an Oolitic structure (see <a href=
"ch2.html#page 37">p. 37</a>). These rocks occupy in England a zone
nearly thirty miles in average breadth, which extends across the
island, from Yorkshire in the north-east, to Dorsetshire in the
south-west. Their mineral characters are not uniform throughout
this region; but the following are the names of the principal
subdivisions observed in the central and south-eastern parts of
England.</p>

<p>The Upper Oolitic system of the above table has usually the
Kimmeridge clay for its base; the Middle Oolitic system, the Oxford
clay. The Lower system reposes on the Lias, an argillo-calcareous
formation, which some include in the Lower Oolite, but which will
be treated of separately in the next chapter. Many of these
subdivisions are distinguished by peculiar organic remains; and,
though varying in thickness, may be traced in certain directions
for great distances, especially if we compare the part of England
to which the above-mentioned type refers with the north-east of
France and the Jura Mountains adjoining. In that country, distant
above 400 geographical miles, the analogy to the accepted English
type, notwithstanding the thinness or occasional absence of the
clays, is more perfect than in Yorkshire or Normandy.</p>

<p><b>Physical Geography.</b>&mdash;The alternation, on a grand
scale, of distinct formations of clay and limestone has caused the
oolitic and liassic series to give rise to some marked features in
the physical outline of parts of England and France. Wide valleys
can usually be traced throughout the long bands of country where
the argillaceous strata crop out; and between these valleys the
limestones are observed, forming ranges of hills or more elevated
grounds. These ranges terminate abruptly on the side on which the
several clays rise up from beneath the calcareous strata.</p>

<center><img src="images2/fig298.jpg" width="368" height="106" alt=
"Fig. 298: Configuration of surface."></center>

<p>Fig. 298 will give the reader an idea of the configuration of
the surface now alluded to, such as may be seen in passing from
London to Cheltenham, or in other parallel lines, from east to
west, in the southern part of England. It has been necessary,
however, in this drawing, greatly to exaggerate the inclination of
the beds, and the height of the several formations, as compared to
their horizontal extent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 323">[ 323 ]</a></p>

<p>It will be remarked, that the lines of steep slope, or
escarpment, face towards the west in the great calcareous eminences
formed by the chalk and the Upper, Middle, and Lower Oolites; and
at the base of which we have respectively the Gault, Kimmeridge
clay, Oxford clay, and Lias. This last forms, generally, a broad
vale at the foot of the escarpment of inferior Oolite, but where it
acquires considerable thickness, and contains solid beds of
marlstone, it occupies the lower part of the escarpment.</p>

<p>The external outline of the country which the geologist observes
in travelling eastward from Paris to Metz, is precisely analogous,
and is caused by a similar succession of rocks intervening between
the tertiary strata and the Lias; with this difference, however,
that the escarpments of Chalk, Upper, Middle, and Lower Oolites
face towards the east instead of the west. It is evident,
therefore, that the denuding causes (see <a href=
"ch6.html#page 105">p. 105</a>) have acted similarly over an area
several hundred miles in diameter, removing the softer clays more
extensively than the limestones, and causing these last to form
steep slopes or escarpments wherever the harder calcareous rock was
based upon a more yielding and destructible formation.</p>

<br>
 

<center><small>UPPER OOLITE.</small></center>

<p><b>Purbeck Beds.</b>&mdash;These strata, which we class as the
uppermost member of the Oolite, are of limited geographical extent
in Europe, as already stated, but they acquire importance when we
consider the succession of three distinct sets of fossil remains
which they contain. Such repeated changes in organic life must have
reference to the history of a vast lapse of ages. The Purbeck beds
are finely exposed to view in Durdlestone Bay, near Swanage,
Dorsetshire, and at Lulworth Cove and the neighbouring bays between
Weymouth and Swanage. At Meup&rsquo;s Bay, in particular, Professor
E. Forbes examined minutely, in 1850, the organic remains of this
group, displayed in a continuous sea-cliff section, and it appears
from his researches that the Upper, Middle, and Lower Purbecks are
each marked by peculiar species of organic remains, these again
being different, so far as a comparison has yet been instituted,
from the fossils of the overlying Hastings Sands and Weald
Clay.</p>

<p><i>Upper Purbeck.</i>&mdash;The highest of the three divisions
is purely fresh-water, the strata, about fifty feet in thickness,
containing shells of the genera <i>Paludina, Physa, Limn&aelig;a,
Planorbis, Valvata, Cyclas,</i> and <i>Unio,</i> with <i>
Cyprides</i> and fish. All the species seem peculiar, and among
these the <i>Cyprides</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 324">[ 324 ]</a></p>

<p>are very abundant and characteristic (see Fig. 299, <i>a, b,
c.</i>)</p>

<p>The stone called &ldquo;Purbeck Marble,&rdquo; formerly much
used in ornamental architecture in the old English cathedrals of
the southern counties, is exclusively procured from this
division.</p>

<center><img src="images2/fig299.jpg" width="410" height="171" alt=
"Fig. 299: Cyprides from the Upper Purbecks."></center>

<p><i>Middle Purbeck.</i>&mdash;Next in succession is the Middle
Purbeck, about thirty feet thick, the uppermost part of which
consists of fresh-water limestone, with cyprides, turtles, and
fish, of different species from those in the preceding strata.
Below the limestone are brackish-water beds full of <i>Cyrena,</i>
and traversed by bands abounding in <i>Corbula</i> and <i>
Melania.</i> These are based on a purely marine deposit, with <i>
Pecten, Modiola, Avicula,</i> and <i>Thracia.</i> Below this,
again, come limestones and shales, partly of brackish and partly of
fresh-water origin, in which many fish, especially species of <i>
Lepidotus</i> and <i>Microdon radiatus,</i> are found, and a
crocodilian reptile named <i>Macrorhynchus.</i> Among the mollusks,
a remarkable ribbed <i>Melania,</i> of the section <i>Chilina,</i>
occurs.</p>

<center><img src="images2/fig300.jpg" width="358" height="190" alt=
"Fig. 300: Ostrea distorta. Fig. 301: Hemicidaris Purbeckensis.">
</center>

<p>Immediately below is a great and conspicuous stratum, twelve
feet thick, formed of a vast accumulation of shells of <i>Ostrea
distorta</i> (Fig. 300), long familiar to geologists under the
local name of &ldquo;Cinder-bed.&rdquo; In the uppermost part
of</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 325">[ 325 ]</a></p>

<center><img src="images2/fig302.jpg" width="411" height="171" alt=
"Fig. 302: Cyprides from the Middle Purbecks."></center>

<p>this bed Professor Forbes discovered the first echinoderm (Fig.
301) as yet known in the Purbeck series, a species of <i>
Hemicidaris,</i> a genus characteristic of the Oolitic period, and
scarcely, if at all, distinguishable from a previously known
Oolitic fossil. It was accompanied by a species of <i>Perna.</i>
Below the Cinder-bed fresh-water strata are again seen, filled in
many places with species of <i>Cypris</i> (Fig. 302, <i>a, b,
c</i>), and with <i>Valvata, Paludina, Planorbis, Limn&aelig;a,
Physa</i> (Fig. 303), and <i>Cyclas,</i> all different from any
occurring higher in the series. It will be seen that <i>Cypris
fasciculata</i> (Fig. 302, <i>b</i>) has tubercles at the end only
of each valve, a character by which it can be immediately
recognised. In fact, these minute crustaceans, almost as frequent
in some of the shales as plates of mica in a micaceous sandstone,
enable geologists at once to identify the Middle Purbeck in places
far from the Dorsetshire cliffs, as, for example, in the Vale of
Wardour in Wiltshire. Thick beds of chert occur in the Middle
Purbeck filled with mollusca and cyprides of the genera already
enumerated, in a beautiful state of preservation, often converted
into chalcedony. Among these Professor Forbes met with gyrogonites
(the spore-vessels of <i>Chara</i>), plants never until 1851
discovered in rocks older than the Eocene. About twenty feet below
the &ldquo;Cinder-bed&rdquo; is a stratum two or three inches
thick, in which fossil mammalia presently to be mentioned occur,
and beneath this a thin band of greenish shales, with marine shells
and impressions of leaves like those of a large <i>Zostera,</i>
forming the base of the Middle Purbeck.</p>

<p><i>Fossil Mammalia of the Middle Purbeck.</i>&mdash;In 1852,*
after alluding to the discovery of numerous insects and
air-breathing mollusca in the Purbeck strata, I remarked that,
although no mammalia had then been found, &ldquo;it was too soon to
infer</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 326">[ 326 ]</a></p>

<p>their non-existence on mere negative evidence.&rdquo; Only two
years after this remark was in print, Mr. W. R. Brodie found in the
Middle Purbeck, about twenty feet below the
&ldquo;Cinder-bed&rdquo; above alluded to, in Durdlestone Bay,
portions of several small jaws with teeth, which Professor Owen
recognised as belonging to a small mammifer of the insectivorous
class, more closely allied in its dentition to the <i>
Amphitherium</i> (or <i>Thylacotherium</i>) than to any existing
type.</p>

<p>Four years later (in 1856) the remains of several other species
of warm-blooded quadrupeds were exhumed by Mr. S. H. Beckles,
<small>F.R.S.</small>, from the same thin bed of marl near the base
of the Middle Purbeck. In this marly stratum many reptiles, several
insects, and some fresh-water shells of the genera <i>Paludina,
Planorbis,</i> and <i>Cyclas,</i> were found.</p>

<p>Mr. Beckles had determined thoroughly to explore the thin layer
of calcareous mud from which in the suburbs of Swanage the bones of
the Spalacotherium had already been obtained, and in three weeks he
brought to light from an area forty feet long and ten wide, and
from a layer the average thickness of which was only five inches,
portions of the skeletons of six new species of mammalia, as
interpreted by Dr. Falconer, who first examined them. Before these
interesting inquiries were brought to a close, the joint labours of
Professor Owen and Dr. Falconer had made it clear that twelve or
more species of mammalia characterised this portion of the Middle
Purbeck, most of them insectivorous or predaceous, varying in size
from that of a mole to that of the common polecat, <i>Mustela
putorius.</i> While the majority had the character of insectivorous
marsupials, Dr. Falconer selected one as differing widely from the
rest, and pointed out that in certain characters it was allied to
the living Kangaroo-rat, or <i>Hypsiprymnus,</i> ten species of
which now inhabit the prairies and scrub-jungle of Australia,
feeding on plants, and gnawing scratched-up roots. A striking
peculiarity of their dentition, one in which they differ from all
other quadrupeds, consists in their having a single large
pre-molar, the enamel of which is furrowed with vertical grooves,
usually seven in number.</p>

<p>The largest pre-molar (see <a href="images2/fig304.jpg">Fig.
305</a>) in the fossil genus exhibits in like manner seven parallel
grooves, producing by their termination a similar serrated edge in
the crown; but their direction is diagonal&mdash;a distinction, says Dr.
Falconer, which is &ldquo;trivial, not typical.&rdquo; As these
oblique furrows form so marked a character of the majority of the
teeth, Dr. Falconer gave to the fossil the generic name of <i>
Plagiaulax.</i> The shape and relative size of the incisor, <i>
a,</i> <a href="images2/fig306.jpg">Fig. 306,</a> exhibit</p>

</center>

<p>a no less striking similarity to Hypsiprymnus. Nevertheless, the
more sudden upward curve of this incisor, as well as other
characters of the jaw, indicate a great deviation in the form of
Plagiaulax from that of the living kangaroo-rats.</p>

<img src="images2/fig306.jpg" width="280" height="247" alt=
"Fig. 306: Plagiaulax Becklessi. Right ramus of lower jaw." align=
"right"> 

<p>There are two fossil specimens of lower jaws of this genus
evidently referable to two distinct species extremely unequal in
size and otherwise distinguishable. The <i>Plagiaulax Becklesii</i>
(Fig. 306) was about as big as the English squirrel or the flying
phalanger of Australia (<i>Petaurus Australis,</i> Waterhouse). The
smaller fossil, having only half the linear dimensions of the
other, was probably only one-twelfth of its bulk. It is of peculiar
geological interest, because, as shown by Dr. Falconer, its two
back molars bear a decided resemblance to those of the Triassic <i>
Microlestes</i> (<a href="images3/fig389.jpg">Fig. 389</a>), the
most ancient of known mammalia, of which an account will be given
in Chapter XXI.</p>

<p>Up to 1857 all the mammalian remains discovered in secondary
rocks had consisted solely of single branches of the lower jaw, but
in that year Mr. Beckles obtained the upper portion of a skull, and
on the same slab the lower jaw of another quadruped with eight
molars, a large canine, and a broad and thick incisor. It has been
named Triconodon from its bicuspid teeth, and is supposed to have
been a small insectivorous marsupial, about the size of a hedgehog.
Other jaws have since been found indicating a larger species of the
same genus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 328">[ 328 ]</a></p>

<p>Professor Owen has proposed the name of <i>Galestes</i> for the
largest of the mammalia discovered in 1858 in Purbeck, equalling
the polecat (<i>Mustela putorius</i>) in size. It is supposed to
have been predaceous and marsupial.</p>

<p>Between forty and fifty pieces or sides of lower jaws with teeth
have been found in oolitic strata in Purbeck; only five upper
maxillaries, together with one portion of a separate cranium, occur
at Stonesfield, and it is remarkable that with these there were no
examples in Purbeck of an entire skeleton, nor of any considerable
number of bones in juxtaposition. In several portions of the matrix
there were detached bones, often much decomposed, and fragments of
others apparently mammalian; but if all of them were restored, they
would scarcely suffice to complete the five skeletons to which the
five upper maxillaries above alluded to belonged. As the average
number of pieces in each mammalian skeleton is about 250, there
must be many thousands of missing bones; and when we endeavour to
account for their absence, we are almost tempted to indulge in
speculations like those once suggested to me by Dr. Buckland, when
he tried to solve the enigma in reference to Stonesfield;
&ldquo;The corpses,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of drowned animals, when
they float in a river, distended by gases during putrefaction, have
often their lower jaw hanging loose, and sometimes it has dropped
off. The rest of the body may then be drifted elsewhere, and
sometimes may be swallowed entire by a predaceous reptile or fish,
such as an ichthyosaur or a shark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As all the above-mentioned Purbeck marsupials, belonging to
eight or nine genera and to about fourteen species, insectivorous,
predaceous, and herbivorous, have been obtained from an area less
than 500 square yards in extent, and from a single stratum no more
than a few inches thick, we may safely conclude that the whole
lived together in the same region, and in all likelihood they
constituted a mere fraction of the mammalia which inhabited the
lands drained by one river and its tributaries. They afford the
first positive proof as yet obtained of the co-existence of a
varied fauna of the highest class of vertebrata with that ample
development of reptile life which marks all the periods from the
Trias to the Lower Cretaceous inclusive, and with a gymnospermous
flora, or that state of the vegetable kingdom when cycads and
conifers predominated over all kinds of plants, except the ferns,
so far, at least, as our present imperfect knowledge of fossil
botany entitles us to speak.</p>

<p>The following table will enable the reader to see at a glance
how conspicuous a part, numerically considered, the mammalian
species of the Middle Purbeck now play when compared</p>

<p>with those of other formations more ancient than the Paris
gypsum, and, at the same time, it will help him to appreciate the
enormous hiatus in the history of fossil mammalia which at present
occurs between the Eocene and Purbeck periods, and between the
latter and the Stonesfield Oolite, and between this again and the
Trias.</p>

<p>The Sables de Bracheux, enumerated in the Tertiary division of
the table, supposed by Mr. Prestwich to be somewhat newer than the
Thanet Sands, and by M. H&eacute;bert to be of about that age, have
yielded at La Fere the <i>Arctocyon (Pal&aelig;ocyon)
prim&aelig;vus,</i> the oldest known tertiary mammal.</p>

<p>It is worthy of notice, that in the Hastings Sands there are
certain layers of clay and sandstone in which numerous footprints
of quadrupeds have been found by Mr. Beckles, and traced by him in
the same set of rocks through Sussex and the Isle of Wight. They
appear to belong to three or four species of reptiles, and no one
of them to any warm-blooded quadruped. They ought, therefore, to
serve as a warning to us, when we fail in like manner to detect
mammalian footprints in older rocks (such as the New Red
Sandstone), to refrain from inferring that quadrupeds, other than
reptilian, did not exist or pre-exist.</p>

<p>But the most instructive lesson read to us by the Purbeck strata
consists in this: They are all, with the exception of a few
intercalated brackish and marine layers, of fresh-water origin;
they are 160 feet in thickness, have been well searched by skillful
collectors, and by the late Edward Forbes in particular, who
studied them for months consecutively. They have been numbered, and
the contents of each stratum recorded separately, by the officers
of the Geological Survey of Great Britain. They have been divided
into three distinct groups by Forbes, each characterised by the
same genera of pulmoniferous mollusca and cyprides, these genera
being represented in each group by different species; they have
yielded insects of many orders, and the fruits of several plants;
and lastly, they contain &ldquo;dirt-beds,&rdquo; or old
terrestrial surfaces and vegetable soils at different levels, in
some of which erect trunks and stumps of cycads and conifers, with
their roots still attached to them, are preserved. Yet when the
geologist inquires if any land-animals of a higher grade than
reptiles lived during any one of these three periods, the rocks are
all silent, save one thin layer a few inches in thickness; and this
single page of the earth&rsquo;s history has suddenly revealed to
us in a few weeks the memorials of so many species of fossil
mammalia, that they already outnumber those of many a subdivision
of the tertiary series, and far surpass those of all the other
secondary rocks put together!</p>

<p><i>Lower Purbeck.</i>&mdash;Beneath the thin marine band
mentioned at <a href="#page 324">p. 324</a> as the base of the
Middle Purbeck, some purely fresh-water marls occur, containing

<p>Middle Purbeck. This is the beginning of the inferior division,
which is about 80 feet thick. Below the marls are seen, at
Meup&rsquo;s Bay, more than thirty feet of brackish-water strata,
abounding in a species of <i>Serpula,</i> allied to, if not
identical with, <i>Serpula coacervites,</i> found in beds of the
same age in Hanover. There are also shells of the genus <i>
Rissoa</i> (of the subgenus <i>Hydrobia</i>), and a little <i>
Cardium</i> of the subgenus <i>Protocardium,</i> in these marine
beds, together with <i>Cypris.</i> Some of the cypris-bearing
shales are strangely contorted and broken up, at the west end of
the Isle of Purbeck. The great dirt-bed or vegetable soil
containing the roots and stools of <i>Cycade&aelig;,</i> which I
shall presently describe, underlies these marls, and rests upon the
lowest fresh-water limestone, a rock about eight feet thick,
containing <i>Cyclas, Valvata,</i> and <i>Limn&aelig;a,</i> of the
same species as those of the uppermost part of the Lower Purbeck,
or above the dirt-bed. The fresh-water limestone in its turn rests
upon the top beds of the Portland stone, which, although it
contains purely marine remains, often consists of a rock
undistinguishable in mineral character from the Lowest Purbeck
limestone.</p>

"Fig. 308: Mantellia nidiformis." align="left"> 

<p><i>Dirt-bed or ancient Surface-soil.</i>&mdash;The most
remarkable of all the varied succession of beds enumerated in the
above list is that called by the quarrymen &ldquo;the dirt,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;black dirt,&rdquo; which was evidently an ancient
vegetable soil. It is from 12 to 18 inches thick, is of a dark
brown or black colour, and contains a large proportion of earthy
lignite. Through it are dispersed rounded and sub-angular fragments
of stone, from 3 to 9 inches in diameter, in such numbers that it
almost deserves the name of gravel. I also saw in 1866, in
Portland, a smaller dirt-bed six feet below the principal one, six
inches thick, consisting of brown earth with upright <i>Cycads</i>
of the same species, <i>Mantellia nidiformis,</i> as those found in
the upper bed, but no <i>Conifer&aelig;.</i> The weight of the
incumbent strata squeezing down the compressible dirt-bed has
caused the <i>Cycads</i> to assume that form which has</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 332">[ 332 ]</a></p>

<p>led the quarrymen to call them &ldquo;petrified birds&rsquo;
nests,&rdquo; which suggested to Brongniart the specific name of
<i>nidiformis.</i> I am indebted to Mr. Carruthers for Figure 308
of one of these Purbeck specimens, in which the original
cylindrical figure has been less distorted than usual by
pressure.</p>

<p>Many silicified trunks of coniferous trees, and the remains of
plants allied to <i>Zamia</i> and <i>Cycas,</i> are buried in this
dirt-bed, and must have become fossil on the spots where they grew.
The stumps of the trees stand erect for a height of from one to
three feet, and even in one instance to six feet, with their roots
attached to the soil at about the same distances from one another
as the trees in a modern forest. The carbonaceous matter is most
abundant immediately around the stumps, and round the remains of
fossil <i>Cycade&aelig;.</i></p>

<p>Besides the upright stumps above mentioned, the dirt-bed
contains the stems of silicified trees laid prostrate. These are
partly sunk into the black earth, and partly enveloped by a
calcareous slate which covers the dirt-bed. The fragments of the
prostrate trees are rarely more than three or four feet in length;
but by joining many of them together, trunks have been restored,
having a length from the root to the branches of from 20 to 23
feet, the stems being undivided for 17 or 20 feet, and then forked.
The diameter of these near the root is about one foot; but I
measured one myself, in 1866, which was 3&frac12; feet in diameter,
said by the quarrymen to be unusually large. Root-shaped cavities
were observed by Professor Henslow to descend from the bottom of
the dirt-bed into the subjacent fresh-water stone, which, though
now solid, must have been in a soft and penetrable state when the
trees grew. The thin layers of calcareous slate (Fig. 309) were
evidently deposited tranquilly, and would have been horizontal but
for the protrusion of the stumps of the trees, around the top of
each of which they form hemispherical concretions.</p>

<center><img src="images2/fig309.jpg" width="391" height="144" alt=
"Fig. 309: Section in Isle of Portland, Dorset."></center>

<p>The dirt-bed is by no means confined to the island of Portland,
where it has been most carefully studied, but is seen</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 333">[ 333 ]</a></p>

<p>in the same relative position in the cliffs east of Lulworth
Cove, in Dorsetshire, where, as the strata have been disturbed, and
are now inclined at an angle of 45&deg;, the stumps of the trees
are also inclined at the same angle in an opposite direction&mdash;a
beautiful illustration of a change in the position of beds
originally horizontal (see Fig. 310).</p>

<center><img src="images2/fig310.jpg" width="384" height="189" alt=
"Fig. 310: Section of cliff east of Lulworth Cove."></center>

<p>From the facts above described we may infer, first, that those
beds of the Upper Oolite, called &ldquo;the Portland,&rdquo; which
are full of marine shells, were overspread with fluviatile mud,
which became dry land, and covered by a forest, throughout a
portion of the space now occupied by the south of England, the
climate being such as to permit the growth of the <i>Zamia</i> and
<i>Cycas.</i> Secondly. This land at length sank down and was
submerged with its forests beneath a body of fresh-water, from
which sediment was thrown down enveloping fluviatile shells.
Thirdly. The regular and uniform preservation of this thin bed of
black earth over a distance of many miles, shows that the change
from dry land to the state of a fresh-water lake or estuary, was
not accompanied by any violent denudation, or rush of water, since
the loose black earth, together with the trees which lay prostrate
on its surface, must inevitably have been swept away had any such
violent catastrophe taken place.</p>

<p>The forest of the dirt-bed, as before hinted, was not everywhere
the first vegetation which grew in this region. Besides the lower
bed containing upright <i>Cycade&aelig;,</i> before mentioned,
another has sometimes been found above it, which implies
oscillations in the level of the same ground, and its alternate
occupation by land and water more than once.</p>

<p><i>Subdivisions of the Purbeck.</i>&mdash;It will be observed
that the division of the Purbecks into upper, middle, and lower,
was made by Professor Forbes strictly on the principle of the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 334">[ 334 ]</a></p>

<p>entire distinctness of the species of organic remains which they
include. The lines of demarkation are not lines of disturbance, nor
indicated by any striking physical characters or mineral changes.
The features which attract the eye in the Purbecks, such as the
dirt-beds, the dislocated strata at Lulworth, and the Cinder-bed,
do not indicate any breaks in the distribution of organised beings.
&ldquo;The causes which led to a complete change of life three
times during the deposition of the fresh-water and brackish strata
must,&rdquo; says this naturalist, &ldquo;be sought for, not simply
in either a rapid or a sudden change of their area into land or
sea, but in the great lapse of time which intervened between the
epochs of deposition at certain periods during their
formation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Each dirt-bed may, no doubt, be the memorial of many thousand
years or centuries, because we find that two or three feet of
vegetable soil is the only monument which many a tropical forest
has left of its existence ever since the ground on which it now
stands was first covered with its shade. Yet, even if we imagine
the fossil soils of the Lower Purbeck to represent as many ages, we
need not be surprised to find that they do not constitute lines of
separation between strata characterised by different zoological
types. The preservation of a layer of vegetable soil, when in the
act of being submerged, must be regarded as a rare exception to a
general rule. It is of so perishable a nature, that it must usually
be carried away by the denuding waves or currents of the sea, or by
a river; and many Purbeck dirt-beds were probably formed in
succession and annihilated, besides those few which now remain.</p>

<p>The plants of the Purbeck beds, so far as our knowledge extends
at present, consist chiefly of Ferns, Conifer&aelig;, and
Cycade&aelig; (<a href="images2/fig308.jpg">Fig. 308</a>), without
any angiosperms; the whole more allied to the Oolitic than to the
Cretaceous vegetation. The same affinity is indicated by the
vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Mr. Brodie has found the
remains of beetles and several insects of the homopterous and
trichopterous orders, some of which now live on plants, while
others are of such forms as hover over the surface of our present
rivers.</p>

<p><b>Portland Oolite and Sand</b> (<i>b,</i> Table <a href=
"#page 321">p. 321</a>).&mdash;The Portland Oolite has already been
mentioned as forming in Dorsetshire the foundation on which the
fresh-water limestone of the Lower Purbeck reposes (see <a href=
"#page 331">p. 331</a>). It supplies the well-known building-stone
of which St. Paul&rsquo;s and so many of the principal edifices of
London are constructed. About fifty species of mollusca occur in
this formation, among which are some ammonites of large size. The

being rarely met with. Also <i>Trigonia gibbosa</i> (Fig. 313) and
<i>Cardium dissimile</i> (<a href="images2/fig314.jpg">Fig.

the Portland Sand, containing similar marine fossils, below which
is the Kimmeridge Clay. In England these Upper Oolite formations
are almost wholly confined to the southern counties. But some
fragments of them occur beneath the Neocomian or Speeton Clay on
the coast of Yorkshire, containing many more fossils common to the
Portlandian of the Continent than does the same formation in
Dorsetshire. Corals are rare in this formation, although one
species is found plentifully at Tisbury, Wiltshire, in the Portland
Sand, converted into flint and chert, the original calcareous
matter being replaced by silex (Fig. 312).</p>

<p><b>Kimmeridge Clay.</b>&mdash;The <i>Kimmeridge Clay</i>
consists, in great part, of a bituminous shale, sometimes forming
an impure coal, several hundred feet in thickness. In some places
in Wiltshire it much resembles peat; and the bituminous matter may
have been, in part at least, derived from the decomposition of
vegetables. But as impressions of plants are rare in these shales,
which contain ammonites, oysters, and other marine shells, with
skeletons of fish and saurians, the bitumen</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 336">[ 336 ]</a></p>

<p>may perhaps be of animal origin. Some of the saurians

kind.</p>

<p>Among the fossils, amounting to nearly 100 species, may be
mentioned <i>Cardium striatulum</i> (Fig. 316) and <i>Ostrea
deltoidea</i> (Fig. 317), the latter found in the Kimmeridge Clay
throughout England and the north of France, and also in Scotland,
near Brora. The <i>Gryph&aelig;a virgula</i> (Fig. 318), also met
with in the Kimmeridge Clay near Oxford, is so abundant in the
Upper Oolite of parts of France as to have caused the deposit to be
termed &ldquo;marnes &agrave; gryph&eacute;es virgules.&rdquo; Near
Clermont, in Argonne, a few leagues from St. Menehould, where these
indurated marls crop out from beneath the Gault, I have seen them,
on decomposing, leave the surface of every ploughed field literally
strewed over with this fossil oyster.</p>

<p>The <i>Trigonellites latus</i> (<i>Aptychus</i> of some authors)
(Fig. 319) is also widely dispersed through this clay. The real
nature of the shell, of which there are many species in oolitic
rocks, is still a matter of conjecture. Some are of opinion that
the two plates have been the gizzard of a cephalopod; others, that
it may have formed a bivalve operculum of the same.</p>

<p><b>Solenhofen Stone.</b>&mdash;The celebrated lithographic stone
of Solenhofen in Bavaria, appears to be of intermediate age between
the Kimmeridge clay and the Coral Rag, presently to be described.
It affords a remarkable example of the variety of fossils which may
be preserved under favourable circumstances, and what delicate
impressions of the tender parts of certain animals and plants may
be retained where the sediment is of extreme fineness. Although the
number of testacea in this slate is small, and the plants few, and
those all marine, count Munster had determined no less than 237
species of fossils when I saw his collection in 1833; and among
them no less than seven <i>species</i> of flying reptiles or
pterodactyls (see Fig. 320), six saurians, three tortoises, sixty
species of fish, forty-six of crustacea, and twenty-six of insects.
These insects, among which is a libellula, or dragon-fly, must have
been blown out to sea, probably from the same land to which the
pterodactyls, and other contemporaneous air-breathers,
resorted.</p>

<p>In the same slate of Solenhofen a fine example was met with in
1862 of the skeleton of a bird almost entire, and retaining even
its feathers so perfect that the vanes as well as the shaft are
preserved. The head was at first supposed to be wanting, but Mr.
Evans detected on the slab what seems to be the impression of the
cranium and beak, much resembling in size and shape that of the jay
or woodcock. This valuable specimen is now in the British Museum,
and has been called by Professor Owen <i>Arch&aelig;opteryx
macrura.</i> Although anatomists agree that it is a true bird, yet
they also find that in the length of the bones of the tail, and
some other minor points of its anatomy, it approaches more nearly
to reptiles than any known living bird. In the living
representatives of the class Aves, the tail-feathers are attached
to a coccygian bone, consisting of several vertebr&aelig; united
together, whereas in the Arch&aelig;opteryx the tail is composed of
twenty vertebr&aelig;, each of which supports a pair of
quill-feathers. The first five only of the vertebr&aelig;, as seen
in A, have transverse processes, the fifteen remaining ones become
gradually longer and more tapering. The feathers diverge outward
from them at an angle of 45&deg;.</p>

<p>Professor Huxley in his late memoirs on the order of reptiles
called Dinosaurians, which are largely represented in all the
formations, from the Neocomian to the Trias inclusive, has shown
that they present in their structure many remarkable affinities to
birds. But a reptile about two feet long, called Compsognathus,
lately found in the Stonesfield slate, makes a much greater
approximation to the class Aves than any Dinosaur, and therefore
forms a closer link between the classes Aves and Reptilia than does
the Arch&aelig;opteryx.</p>

<p>It appears doubtful whether any species of British fossil,
whether of the vertebrate or invertebrate class, is common to the
Oolite and Chalk. But there is no similar break or discordance as
we proceed downward, and pass from one to another of the several
leading members of the Jurassic group, the Upper, Middle, and Lower
Oolite, and the Lias, there being often a considerable proportion
of the mollusca, sometimes as much as a fourth, common to such
divisions as the Upper and Middle Oolite.</p>

<p><b>Coral Rag.</b>&mdash;One of the limestones of the Middle
Oolite has been called the &ldquo;Coral Rag,&rdquo; because it
consists, in part, of continuous beds of petrified corals, most of
them retaining the position in which they grew at the bottom of the
sea. In their forms they more frequently resemble the reef-building
polyparia of the Pacific than do the corals of any other member of
the Oolite. They belong chiefly to the genera <i>Thecosmilia</i>
(Fig. 322), <i>Protoseris,</i> and <i>Thamnastr&aelig;a,</i> and
sometimes form masses of coral fifteen feet thick.</p>

<p>In Fig. 323 of a <i>Thamnastr&aelig;a</i> from this formation,
it will be seen that the cup-shaped cavities are deepest on the
right-hand side, and that they grow more and more shallow, until
those on the left side are nearly filled up. The last-mentioned
stars are supposed to represent a perfected condition, and the
others an immature state. These coralline strata extend through the
calcareous hills of the north-west of Berkshire, and north of
Wilts, and again recur in Yorkshire, near Scarborough. The <i>
Ostrea gregarea</i> (Fig. 324) is very characteristic of the
formation in England and on the Continent.</p>

<p>One of the limestones of the Jura, referred to the age of the

<p><b>Oxford Clay.</b>&mdash;The coralline limestone, or
&ldquo;Coral Rag,&rdquo; above described, and the accompanying
sandy beds, called &ldquo;calcareous grits,&rdquo; of the Middle
Oolite, rest on a thick bed of clay, called the &ldquo;Oxford
Clay,&rdquo; sometimes not less than 600 feet thick. In this there
are no corals, but great abundance of cephalopoda, of the genera
Ammonite and Belemnite (Figs. 326 and 327). In some of the finely
laminated clays ammonites are very perfect, although somewhat
compressed, and are frequently found with the lateral lobe extended
on each side of the opening of the mouth into a horn-like
projection (Figure 327). These were discovered in the cuttings of
the Great Western Railway, near Chippenham, in 1841, and have been
described by Mr. Pratt (<i>An. Nat. Hist.,</i> Nov., 1841).</p>

<p>Similar elongated processes have been also observed to extend
from the shells of some Belemnites discovered by Dr. Mantell in the

singular extinct forms of cuttle-fish.*</p>

passes under this name is generally grouped as a member of the
Oxford clay, in which it forms, in the south-west of England,
lenticular masses, 8 or 10 feet thick, containing at Kelloway, in
Wiltshire, numerous casts of ammonites and other shells. But in
Yorkshire this calcareo-arenaceous formation thickens to about 30
feet, and constitutes the lower part of the Middle Oolite,
extending inland from Scarborough in a southerly direction. The
number of mollusca which it contains is, according to Mr.
Etheridge, 143, of which only 34, or 23&frac12; per cent, are
common to the Oxford clay proper. Of the 52 Cephalopoda, 15 (namely
13 species of ammonite, the <i>Ancyloceras Calloviense</i> and one
Belemnite) are common to the Oxford Clay, giving a proportion of

<p><b>Cornbrash and Forest Marble.</b>&mdash;The upper division of
this series, which is more extensive than the preceding or Middle
Oolite, is called in England the Cornbrash, as being a brashy,
easily broken rock, good for corn land. It consists of clays and
calcareous sandstones, which pass downward into the Forest Marble,
an argillaceous limestone, abounding in marine fossils. In some
places, as at Bradford, this limestone is replaced by a mass of
clay. The sandstones of the Forest Marble of Wiltshire are often
ripple-marked and filled with fragments of broken shells and pieces
of drift-wood, having evidently been formed on a coast. Rippled
slabs of fissile oolite are used for roofing, and have been traced
over a broad band of country from Bradford in Wilts, to Tetbury in
Gloucestershire. These calcareous tile-stones are separated from
each other by thin seams of clay, which have been deposited upon
them, and have taken their form, preserving the undulating ridges
and furrows of the sand in such complete integrity, that the
impressions of small footsteps, apparently of crustaceans, which
walked over the soft wet sands, are still visible. In the same
stone the claws of crabs, fragments</p>

<p><b>Great (or Bath) Oolite.</b>&mdash;Although the name of Coral
Rag has been appropriated, as we have seen, to a member of the
Middle Oolite before described, some portions of the Lower Oolite
are equally entitled in many places to be called coralline
limestones. Thus the Great Oolite near Bath contains various
corals, among which the <i>Eunomia radiata</i> (Fig. 329) is very
conspicuous, single individuals forming masses several feet in
diameter; and having probably required, like the large existing
brain-coral (<i>Meandrina</i>) of the tropics, many centuries
before their growth was completed.</p>

"Fig. 329: Eunomia radiata."></center>

<p>Different species of crinoids, or stone-lilies, are also common
in the same rocks with corals; and, like them, must have enjoyed a
firm bottom, where their base of attachment remained undisturbed
for years (<i>c,</i> Fig. 330). Such fossils, therefore, are almost
confined to the limestones; but an exception occurs at Bradford,
near Bath, where they are enveloped in clay sometimes 60 feet
thick. In this case, however, it appears that the solid upper
surface of the &ldquo;Great Oolite&rdquo; had supported, for a
time, a thick submarine forest of these beautiful zoophytes, until
the clear and still water was invaded by a current charged with
mud, which threw down the stone-lilies, and broke most of their
stems short off near the point of attachment. The stumps still
remain in their original position; but the numerous articulations,
once composing the stem, arms, and body of the encrinite, were
scattered at random through the argillaceous deposit in which some
now lie prostrate. These appearances are represented in the section
<i>b,</i> Fig. 330, where the darker strata represent the Bradford
clay, which is however a formation</p>

<p>of such local development that in many places it can not easily
be separated from the clays of the overlying
&ldquo;forest-marble&rdquo; and underlying &ldquo;fuller&rsquo;s
earth.&rdquo; The upper surface of the calcareous stone below is
completely incrusted over with a continuous pavement, formed by the
stony roots or attachments of the Crinoidea; and besides this
evidence of the length of time they had lived on the spot, we find
great numbers of single joints, or circular plates of the stem and
body of the encrinite, covered over with <i>serpul&aelig;.</i> Now
these <i>serpul&aelig;</i> could only have begun to grow after the
death of some of the stone-lilies, parts of whose skeletons had
been strewed over the floor of the ocean before the irruption of
argillaceous mud. In some instances we find that, after the
parasitic <i>serpul&aelig;</i> were full grown, they had become
incrusted over with a bryozoan, called <i>Diastopora diluviana</i>
(see <i>b,</i> Fig. 331);</p>

<p>and many generations of these molluscoids had succeeded each
other in the pure water before they became fossil.</p>

<p>We may, therefore, perceive distinctly that, as the pines and
cycadeous plants of the ancient &ldquo;dirt-bed,&rdquo; or fossil
forest, of the Lower Purbeck were killed by submergence under fresh
water, and soon buried beneath muddy sediment, so an invasion of
argillaceous matter put a sudden stop to the growth of the Bradford
Encrinites, and led to their preservation in marine strata.</p>

<p>Such differences in the fossils as distinguish the calcareous
and argillaceous deposits from each other, would be described by
naturalists as arising out of a difference in the <i>stations</i>
of species; but besides these, there are variations in the fossils
of the higher, middle, and lower part of the oolitic series, which
must be ascribed to that great law of change in organic life by
which distinct assemblages of species have been adapted, at
successive geological periods, to the varying conditions of the
habitable surface. In a single district it is difficult to decide
how far the limitation of species to certain minor formations has
been due to the local influence of <i>stations,</i> or how far it
has been caused by time or the law of variation above alluded to.
But we recognise the reality of the last-mentioned influence, when
we contrast the whole oolitic series of England with that of parts
of the Jura, Alps, and other distant regions, where, although there
is scarcely any lithological resemblance, yet some of the same
fossils remain peculiar in each country to the Upper, Middle, and
Lower Oolite formations respectively. Mr. Thurmann has shown how
remarkably this fact holds true in the Bernese Jura, although the
argillaceous divisions, so conspicuous in England, are feebly
represented there, and some entirely wanting.</p>

<p>The calcareous portion of the Great Oolite consists of several
shelly limestones, one of which, called the Bath Oolite, is much
celebrated as a building-stone. In parts of Gloucestershire,
especially near Minchinhampton, the Great Oolite, says Mr. Lycett,
&ldquo;must have been deposited in a shallow sea, where strong
currents prevailed, for there are frequent changes in the mineral
character of the deposit, and some beds exhibit false
stratification. In others, heaps of broken shells are mingled with
pebbles of rocks foreign to the neighbourhood, and with fragments
of abraded madrepores, dicotyledonous wood, and crabs&rsquo; claws.
The shelly strata, also, have occasionally suffered denudation, and
the removed portions have been replaced by clay.&rdquo; In such
shallow-water</p>

<p>beds shells of the genera <i>Patella, Nerita, Rimula,
Cylindrites</i> are common (see Figs. 334 to 337); while
cephalopods are rare, and instead of ammonites and belemnites,
numerous genera of carnivorous trachelipods appear. Out of 224
species of univalves obtained from the Minchinhampton beds, Mr.
Lycett found no less than 50 to be carnivorous. They belong
principally to the genera <i>Buccinum, Pleurotoma, Rostellaria,
Murex, Purpuroidea</i> (Fig. 333), and Fusus, and exhibit a
proportion of zoophagous species not very different from that which
obtains in seas of the Recent period. These zoological results are
curious and unexpected, since it was imagined that we might look in
vain for the carnivorous trachelipods in rocks of such high
antiquity as the Great Oolite, and it was a received doctrine that
they did not begin to appear in considerable numbers till the
Eocene period, when those two great families of cephalopoda, the
ammonites and belemnites, and a great number of other
representatives of the same class of chambered shells, had become
extinct.</p>

<p><b>Stonesfield Slate: Mammalia.</b>&mdash;The slate of
Stonesfield has been shown by Mr. Lonsdale to lie at the base of
the Great Oolite.* It is a slightly oolitic shelly limestone,
forming large lenticular masses imbedded in sand only six feet
thick,</p>

<p>but very rich in organic remains. It contains some pebbles of a
rock very similar to itself, and which may be portions of the
deposit, broken up on a shore at low water or during storms, and
redeposited. The remains of belemnites, trigoni&aelig;, and other
marine shells, with fragments of wood, are common, and impressions
of ferns, cycade&aelig;, and other plants. Several insects, also,
and, among the rest, the elytra or wing-covers of beetles, are
perfectly preserved (see Fig. 338), some of them approaching nearly
to the genus Buprestis. The remains, also, of many genera of
reptiles, such as <i>Plesiosaur, Crocodile,</i> and <i>
Pterodactyl,</i> have been discovered in the same limestone.</p>

<img src="images2/fig338.jpg" width="84" height="190" alt=
"Fig. 338: Elytron of Buprestis?" align="left"> 

<p>But the remarkable fossils for which the Stonesfield slate is
most celebrated are those referred to the mammiferous class. The
student should be reminded that in all the rocks described in the
preceding chapters as older than the Eocene, no bones of any
land-quadruped, or of any cetacean, had been discovered until the
<i>Spalacotherium</i> of the Purbeck beds came to light in 1854.
Yet we have seen that terrestrial plants were not wanting in the
Upper Cretaceous formation (see <a href="ch17.html#page 302">p.
302</a>), and that in the Wealden there was evidence of fresh-water
sediment on a large scale, containing various plants, and even
ancient vegetable soils. We had also in the same Wealden many
land-reptiles and winged insects, which render the absence of
terrestrial quadrupeds the more striking. The want, however, of any
bones of whales, seals, dolphins, and other aquatic mammalia,
whether in the chalk or in the upper or middle oolite, is certainly
still more remarkable.</p>

<p>These observations are made to prepare the reader to appreciate
more justly the interest felt by every geologist in the discovery
in the Stonesfield slate of no less than ten specimens of lower
jaws of mammiferous quadrupeds, belonging to four different species
and to three distinct genera, for which the names of <i>
Amphitherium, Phascolotherium,</i> and <i>Stereognathus</i> have
been adopted.</p>

<p>It is now generally admitted that these or really the remains of
mammalia (although it was at first suggested that they might be
reptiles), and the only question open to controversy is limited to
this point, whether the fossil mammalia found in the Lower
Oolite</p>

<p>of Oxfordshire ought to be referred to the marsupial quadrupeds,
or to the ordinary placental series. Cuvier had long ago pointed
out a peculiarity in the form of the angular process (<i>c,</i>
Figs. 342 and 343) of the lower jaw, as a character of the genus
<i>Didelphys</i>; and Professor Owen has since confirmed the
doctrine of its generality in the entire marsupial series. In all
these pouched quadrupeds this process is turned inward, as at <i>c,
d,</i> Fig. 342, in the Brazilian opossum, whereas in the placental
series, as at <i>c,</i> Figs. 340 and 341, there is an almost
entire absence of such inflection. The <i>Tupaia Tana</i> of
Sumatra has been selected by Mr. Waterhouse for this illustration,
because the jaws of that small insectivorous quadruped bear a great
resemblance to those of the Stonesfield <i>Amphitherium.</i> By
clearing away the matrix from the specimen of <i>Amphitherium
Prevostii</i> here represented (Fig. 344), Professor Owen
ascertained that the angular process (<i>c</i>) bent inward in a
slighter degree than in any of the known marsupialia; in short, the
inflection does not exceed that of the mole or hedgehog. This fact
made him doubt whether</p>

<p>the <i>Amphitherium</i> might not be an insectivorous placental,
although it offered some points of approximation in its osteology
to the marsupials, especially to the <i>Myrmecobius,</i> a small
insectivorous quadruped of Australia, which has nine molars on each
side of the lower jaw, besides a canine and three incisors.*
Another species of <i>Amphitherium</i> has been found at
Stonesfield (Fig. 345), which differs from the former (Fig. 344)
principally in being larger.</p>

<center><img src="images2/fig345.jpg" width="375" height="126" alt=

<p>The second mammiferous genus discovered in the same slates was
named originally by Mr. Broderip <i>Didelphys Bucklandi</i> (see
Fig. 346), and has since been called <i>Phascolotherium</i> by
Owen. It manifests a much stronger likeness to the marsupials in
the general form of the jaw, and in the extent and position of its
inflected angle, while the agreement with the living genus
Didelphys in the number of the pre-molar and molar teeth is
complete.&dagger;</p>

<p>In 1854 the remains of another mammifer, small in size, but
larger than any of those previously known, was brought to light.
The generic name of <i>Stereognathus</i> was given to it, and, as
is usually the case in these old rocks (see <a href="#page 328">p.
328</a>), it consisted of part of a lower jaw, in which were
implanted three double-fanged teeth, differing in structure from
those of all other known recent or extinct mammals.</p>

<p><b>Plants of the Oolite.</b>&mdash;The Araucarian pines, which
are now abundant in Australia and its islands, together with
marsupial quadrupeds, are found in like manner to have accompanied
the marsupials in Europe during the Oolitic period (see <a href=
"images2/fig347.jpg">Fig. 348</a>). In the same rock endogens of
the most perfect structure are met with, as, for example, fruits
allied to the Pandanus, such as the <i>Kaidacarpum ooliticum</i> of
Carruthers in the Great Oolite, and the <i>Podocarya</i> of
Buckland (see <a href="images2/fig347.jpg">Fig. 347</a>) in the

<p><b>Inferior Oolite.</b>&mdash;This formation consists of a
calcareous freestone, usually of small thickness, but attaining in
some places, as in the typical area of Cheltenham and the Western
Cotswolds, a thickness of 250 feet. It sometimes rests upon yellow
sands, formerly classed as the sands of the Inferior Oolite, but
now regarded as a member of the Upper Lias. These sands repose upon
the Upper Lias clays in the south and west of England. The
Collyweston slate, formerly classed with the Great Oolite, and
supposed to represent in Northamptonshire the Stonesfield slate, is
now found to belong to the Inferior Oolite, both by community of
species and position in the series. The Collyweston beds, on the
whole, assume a much more marine character than the Stonesfield
slate. Nevertheless, one of the fossil plants <i>Aroides
Stutterdi,</i> Carruthers, remarkable, like the Pandanaceous
species before mentioned (Fig. 347) as a representative of the
monocotyledonous class, is common to the Stonesfield beds in

<p>coal-field, thin seams of coal having actually been worked in
them for more than a century. A rich harvest of fossil ferns has
been obtained from them, as at Gristhorpe, near Scarborough (Fig.
350). They contain also Cycade&aelig;, of which family a
magnificent specimen has been described by Mr. Williamson under the
name Zamia gigas, and a fossil called <i>Equisetum Columnare</i>
(see <a href="images3/fig397.jpg">Fig. 397</a>), which maintains an

with the above, or at least belonging to some of the lower
divisions of the Oolitic period, has been mined extensively for a
century or more. It affords the thickest stratum of pure vegetable
matter hitherto detected in any secondary rock in England. One seam
of coal of good quality has been worked three and a half feet

<p>In illustration of shells having a great vertical range, it may
be stated that in England some few species pass up from the Lower

Lithodomus inclusus, Pholadomya ovalis,</i> and <i>Trigonia

between the larger and smaller sections of the English Oolites,
imply intervals of time, elsewhere represented by fossiliferous
strata, although no deposit may have taken place in the British
area. This conclusion is warranted by the partial extent of many of
the minor and some of the larger divisions even in England.</p>
