<center><small>CAMBRIAN &nbsp;GROUP.</small></center>

<p>The characters of the Upper and Lower Silurian rocks were
established so fully, both on stratigraphical and
pal&aelig;ontological data, by Sir Roderick Murchison after five
years&rsquo; labour, in 1839, when his &ldquo;Silurian
System&rdquo; was published, that these formations could from that
period be recognised and identified in all other parts of Europe
and in North America, even in countries where most of the fossils
differed specifically from those of the classical region in
Britain, where they were first studied.</p>

<p>While Sir R. I. Murchison was exploring in 1833, in Shropshire
and the borders of Wales, the strata which in 1835 he first called
Silurian, Professor Sedgwick was surveying the rocks of North
Wales, which both these geologists considered at that period as of
older date, and for which in 1836 Sedgwick proposed the name of
Cambrian. It was afterwards found that a large portion of the slaty
rocks of North Wales, which had been considered as more ancient
than the Llandeilo beds and Stiper-Stones before alluded to, were,
in reality, not inferior in position to those Lower Silurian beds
of Murchison, but merely extensive undulations of the same, bearing
fossils identical in species, though these were generally rarer and
less perfectly preserved, owing to the changes which the rocks had
undergone from metamorphic action. To such rocks the term
&ldquo;Cambrian&rdquo; was no longer applicable, although it
continued to be appropriate to strata inferior to the
Stiper-Stones, and which were older than those of the Lower
Silurian group as originally defined. It was not till 1846 that
fossils were found in Wales in the Lingula</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 482">[ 482 ]</a></p>

<p>flags, the place of which will be seen in the table below. By
this time Barrande had already published an account of a rich
collection of fossils which he had discovered in Bohemia, portions
of which he recognised as of corresponding age with
Murchison&rsquo;s Upper and Lower Silurian, while others were more
ancient, to which he gave the name of &ldquo;Primordial,&rdquo; for
the fossils were sufficiently distinct to entitle the rocks to be
referred to a new period. They consisted chiefly of trilobites of
genera distinct from those occurring in the overlying Silurian
formations. These peculiar genera were afterwards found in rocks
holding a corresponding position in Wales, and I shall retain for
them the term Cambrian, as recent discoveries in our own country
seem to carry the first fauna of Barrande, or his primordial type,
even into older strata than any which he found to be fossiliferous
in Bohemia.</p>

<p>The term primordial was intended to express M. Barrande&rsquo;s
own belief that the fossils of the rocks so-called afforded
evidence of the first appearance of vital phenomena on this planet,
and that consequently no fossiliferous strata of older date would
or could ever be discovered. The acceptance of such a nomenclature
would seem to imply that we despaired of extending our discoveries
of new and more ancient fossil groups at some future day when vast
portions of the globe, hitherto unexplored, should have been
thoroughly surveyed. Already the discovery of the Laurentian Eozoon
in Canada, presently to be mentioned, discountenances such
views.</p>

<p>The following table will show the succession of the strata in
England and Wales which belong to the Cambrian group or the
fossiliferous rocks older than the Arenig or Lower Llandeilo
rocks:</p>

<p><b>Tremadoc Slates.</b>&mdash;The Tremadoc slates of Sedgwick
are more than 1000 feet in thickness, and consist of dark earthy
slates occurring near the little town of Tremadoc, situated on the
north side of Cardigan Bay, in Carnarvonshire. These</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 483">[ 483 ]</a></p>

<p>slates were first examined by Sedgwick in 1831, and were
re-examined by him and described in 1846,* after some fossils had
been found in the underlying Lingula flags by Mr. Davis. The
inferiority in position of these Lingula flags to the Tremadoc beds
was at the same time established. The overlying Tremadoc beds were
traced by their pisolitic ore from Tremadoc to Dolgelly. No fossils
proper to the Tremadoc slates were then observed, but subsequently,
thirty-six species of all classes have been found in them, thanks
to the researches of Messrs. Salter, Homfray, and Ash. We have
already seen that in the Arenig or Stiper-Stones group, where the
species are distinct, the genera agree with Silurian types; but in
these Tremadoc slates, where the species are also peculiar, there
is about an equal admixture of Silurian types with those which
Barrande has termed &ldquo;primordial.&rdquo; Here, therefore, it
may truly be said that we are entering upon a new domain of life in
our retrospective survey of the past. The trilobites of new
species, but of Lower Silurian genera, belong to <i>Ogygia,
Asaphus,</i> and <i>Cheirurus</i>; whereas those belonging to
primordial types, or Barrande&rsquo;s first fauna as well as to the
Lingula flags of Wales, comprise <i>Dikelocephalus, Conocoryphe</i>
(for genera see <a href="images4/fig576.jpg">Fig. 577</a> and
581),&dagger; <i>Olenus,</i> and <i>Angelina.</i></p>

<img src="images4/fig568.jpg" width="99" height="198" alt=
"Fig. 568: Theca (Cleidotheca operculata." align="right"> 

<p>In the Tremadoc slates are found <i>Bellerophon, Orthoceras,</i>
and <i>Cyrtoceras,</i> all specifically distinct from Lower
Silurian fossils of the same genera: the Pteropods <i>Theca</i>
(Fig. 568) and <i>Conularia</i> range throughout these slates;
there are no Graptolites. The <i>Lingula (Lingulella) Davisii</i>
ranges from the top to the bottom of the formation, and links it
with the zone next to be described. The Tremadoc slates are very
local, and seem to be confined to a small part of North Wales; and
Professor Ramsay supposes them to lie unconformably on the Lingula
flags, and that a long interval of time elapsed between these
formations. Cephalopoda have not yet been found lower than this
group, but it will be observed that they occur here associated with
genera of Trilobites considered by Barrande as characteristically
Primordial, some of which belong to all the divisions of the
British Cambrian about to be mentioned. This renders the absence of
cephalopoda of less importance as bearing on the theory of
development.</p>

<p class="fnote">* Quart. Geol. Journ., vol. iii, p. 156.<br>
&dagger; This genus has been substituted for Barrande&rsquo;s <i>
Conocephalus,</i> as the latter term had been preoccupied by the
entomologists.</p>

</center>

<p><b>Lingula Flags.</b>&mdash;Next below the Tremadoc slates in
North Wales lie micaceous flagstones and slates, in which, in 1846,
Mr. E. Davis discovered the <i>Lingula (Lingulella),</i> Fig. 570,
named after him, and from which was derived the name of Lingula
flags. These beds, which are pal&aelig;ontologically the
equivalents of Barrande&rsquo;s primordial zone, are represented by
more than 5000 feet of strata, and have been studied chiefly in the
neighbourhood of Dolgelly, Ffestiniog, and Portmadoc in North
Wales, and at St. David&rsquo;s in South Wales. They have yielded
about forty species of fossils, of which six only are common to the
overlying Tremadoc rocks, but the two formations are closely allied
by having several characteristic &ldquo;primordial&rdquo; genera in
common. <i>Dikelocephalus, Olenus</i> (Fig. 571), and <i>Conocoryphe</i> are prominent forms, as is also <i>Hymenocaris</i>
(Fig. 569), a genus of phyllopod crustacean entirely confined to
the Lingula Flags. According to Mr. Belt, who has devoted much
attention to these beds, there are already pal&aelig;ontological
data for subdividing the Lingula Flags into three sections.*</p>

<p>In Merionethshire, according to Professor Ramsay, the Lingula
Flags attain their greatest development; in Carnarvonshire they
thin out so as to have lost two-thirds of their thickness in eleven
miles, while in Anglesea and on the Menai Straits both they and the
Tremadoc beds are entirely absent, and the Lower Silurian rests
directly on Lower Cambrian strata.</p>

<br>
 

<center><small>LOWER &nbsp;CAMBRIAN.</small></center>

<p><b>Menevian Beds.</b>&mdash;Immediately beneath the Lingula
Flags there occurs a series of dark grey and black flags and slates
alternating at the upper part with some beds of sandstone, the
whole reaching a thickness of from 500 to 600 feet. These beds were
formerly classed, on purely lithological</p>

<p>grounds, as the base of the Lingula Flags, but Messrs. Hicks and
Salter, to whose exertions we owe almost all our knowledge of the
fossils, have pointed out* that the most characteristic genera
found in them are quite unknown in the Lingula Flags, while they
possess many of the strictly Lower Cambrian genera, such as <i>
Microdiscus</i> and <i>Paradoxides.</i> They therefore proposed to
place them, and it seems to me with good reason, at the top of the
Lower Cambrian under the term &ldquo;Menevian,&rdquo; Menevia being
the classical name of St. David&rsquo;s. The beds are well
exhibited in the neighbourhood of St. David&rsquo;s in South Wales,
and near Dolgelly and Maentwrog in North Wales. They are the
equivalents of the lowest part of Barrande&rsquo;s Primordial Zone
(&Eacute;tage C). More than forty species have been found in them,
and the group is altogether very rich in fossils for so early a
period.</p>

<img src="images4/fig572.jpg" width="138" height="281" alt=
"Fig. 572: Paradoxides Davidis." align="right"> 

<p>The trilobites are of large size; <i>Paradoxides Davidis</i>
(see Fig. 572), the largest trilobite known in England, 22 inches
or nearly two feet long, is peculiar to the Menevian Beds. By
referring to the Bohemian trilobite of the same genus (<a href=
"images4/fig576.jpg">Fig. 576</a>), the reader will at once see how
these fossils (though of such different dimensions) resemble each
other in Bohemia and Wales, and other closely allied species from
the two regions might be added, besides some which are common to
both countries. The Swedish fauna, presently to be mentioned, will
be found to be still more nearly connected with the Welsh Menevian.
In all these countries there is an equally marked difference
between the Cambrian fossils and those of the Upper and Lower
Silurian rocks. The trilobite with the largest number of rings, <i>
Erinnys venulosa,</i> occurs here in conjunction with <i>
Agnostus</i> and <i>Microdiscus,</i> the genera with the smallest
number. Blind trilobites are also found as well as those which have
the largest eyes, such as <i>Microdiscus</i> on the one hand, and
<i>Anoplenus</i> on the other.</p>

<br>
 

<center><small>LONGMYND&nbsp; GROUP.</small></center>

<p>Older than the Menevian Beds are a thick series of olive green,
purple, red and grey grits and conglomerates found in North and
South Wales, Shropshire, and parts of Ireland</p>

<p class="fnote">* British Association Report 1865, 1866, 1868 and

<p>and Scotland. They have been called by Professor Sedgwick the
Longmynd or Bangor Group, comprising, first, the Harlech and
Barmouth sandstones; and secondly, the Llanberis slates.</p>

<img src="images4/fig573.jpg" width="242" height="225" alt=
"Fig. 573: Histioderma Hibernica." align="left"> 

<p><b>Harlech Grits.</b>&mdash;The sandstones of this period attain
in the Longmynd hills a thickness of no less than 6000 feet without
any interposition of volcanic matter; in some places in
Merionethshire they are still thicker. Until recently these rocks
possessed but a very scanty fauna.</p>

<p>With the exception of five species of annelids (see <a href=
"images3/fig460.jpg">Fig. 460</a>) brought to light by Mr. Salter
in Shropshire, and Dr. Kinahan in Wicklow, and an obscure
crustacean form, <i>Pal&aelig;opyge Ramsayi,</i> they were supposed
to be barren of organic remains. Now, however, through the labours
of Mr. Hicks,&nbsp; they have yielded at St. David&rsquo;s a rich
fauna of trilobites, brachiopods, phyllopods, and pteropods,
showing, together with other fossils, a by no means low state of
organisation at this early period. Already the fauna amounts to 20
species referred to 17 genera.</p>

<p>A new genus of trilobite called <i>Plutonia Sedgwickii,</i> not
yet figured and described, has been met with in the Harlech grits.
It is comparable in size to the large <i>Paradoxides Davidis</i>
before mentioned, has well-developed eyes, and is covered all over
with tubercles. In the same strata occur other genera of
trilobites, namely, <i>Conocoryphe, Paradoxides, Microdiscus,</i>
and the Pteropod <i>Theca</i> (<a href="images4/fig568.jpg">Fig.
568</a>), all represented by species peculiar to the Harlech grits.
The sands of this formation are often rippled, and were evidently
left dry at low tides, so that the surface was dried by the sun and
made to shrink and present sun-cracks. There are also distinct
impressions of rain-drops on many surfaces, like those in <a href=
"images3/fig444.jpg">Fig. 444</a> and 445.</p>

<p><b>Lanberis Slates.</b>&mdash;The slates of Llanberis and
Penrhyn in Carnarvonshire, with their associated sandy strata,
attain a great thickness, sometimes about 3000 feet. They are
perhaps not more ancient than the Harlech and Barmouth beds last
mentioned, for they may represent the deposits of fine</p>

sands above-mentioned were accumulating. In some of these slaty
rocks in Ireland, immediately opposite Anglesea and Carnarvon, two
species of fossils have been found, to which the late Professor E.
Forbes gave the name of <i>Oldhamia.</i> The nature of these
organisms is still a matter of discussion among naturalists.</p>

<p><b>Cambrian Rocks of Bohemia</b> <i>(Primordial zone of
Barrande).</i>&mdash;In the year 1846, as before stated, M. Joachim
Barrande, after ten years&rsquo; exploration of Bohemia, and after
collecting more than a thousand species of fossils, had ascertained
the existence in that country of three distinct faunas below the
Devonian. To his first fauna, which was older than any then known
in this country, he gave the name of &Eacute;tage C; his two first
stages A and B consisting of crystalline and metamorphic rocks and
unfossiliferous schists. This &Eacute;tage C or primordial zone
proved afterwards to be the equivalent of those subdivisions of the
Cambrian groups which have been above described under the names of
Menevian and Lingula Flags. The second fauna tallies with
Murchison&rsquo;s Lower Silurian, as originally defined by him when
no fossils had been discovered below the Stiper-Stones. The third
fauna agrees with the Upper Silurian of the same author. Barrande,
without government assistance, had undertaken single-handed the
geological survey of Bohemia, the fossils previously obtained from
that country having scarcely exceeded 20 in number, whereas he had
already acquired, in 1850, no less than 1100 species, namely, 250
crustaceans (chiefly Trilobites), 250 Cephalopods, 160 gasteropods
and pteropods, 130 acephalous mollusks, 210 brachiopods, and 110
corals and other fossils. These numbers have since been almost
doubled by subsequent investigations in the same country.</p>

<p>In the primordial zone C, he discovered trilobites of the genera
<i>Paradoxides, Conocoryphe, Ellipsocephalus, Sao, Arionellus,
Hydrocephalus,</i> and <i>Agnostus.</i> M. Barrande pointed out
that these primordial trilobites have a peculiar facies of</p>

<p>their own dependent on the multiplication of their thoracic
segments and the diminution of their caudal shield or pygidium.</p>

<p>One of the &ldquo;primordial&rdquo; or Upper Cambrian Trilobites
of the genus <i>Sao,</i> a form not found as yet elsewhere in the
world, afforded M. Barrande a fine illustration of the
metamorphosis of these creatures, for he traced them through no
less than twenty stages of their development. A few of these
changes have been selected for representation in Figure 580, that
the reader may learn the gradual manner in which different segments
of the body and the eyes make their appearance.</p>

<p>In Bohemia the primordial fauna of Barrande derived its
importance exclusively from its numerous and peculiar trilobites.
Besides these, however, the same ancient schists have yielded two
genera of brachiopods, <i>Orthis</i> and <i>Orbicula,</i> a
Pteropod of the genus <i>Theca,</i> and four echinoderms of the
cystidean family.</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 489">[ 489 ]</a></p>

<p><b>Cambrian of Sweden and Norway.</b>&mdash;The Cambrian beds of
Wales are represented in Sweden by strata the fossils of which have
been described by a most able naturalist, M. Angelin, in his
&ldquo;Pal&aelig;ontologica Suecica&rdquo; (1852-4). The
&ldquo;alum-schists,&rdquo; as they are called in Sweden, are
horizontal argillaceous rocks which underlie conformably certain
Lower Silurian strata in the mountain called Kinnekulle, south of
the great Wener Lake in Sweden. These schists contain trilobites
belonging to the genera <i>Paradoxides, Olenus, Agnostus,</i> and
others, some of which present rudimentary forms, like the genus
last mentioned, without eyes, and with the body segments scarcely
developed, and others, again, have the number of segments
excessively multiplied, as in <i>Paradoxides.</i> Such
peculiarities agree with the characters of the crustaceans met with
in the Cambrian strata of Wales; and Dr. Torell has recently found
in Sweden the <i>Paradoxides Hicksii,</i> a well-known Lower
Cambrian fossil.</p>

<p>At the base of the Cambrian strata in Sweden, which in the
neighbourhood of Lake Wener are perfectly horizontal, lie
ripple-marked quartzose sandstones with worm-tracks and annelid
borings, like some of those found in the Harlech grits of the
Longmynd. Among these are some which have been referred doubtfully
to plants. These sandstones have been called in Sweden
&ldquo;fucoid sandstones.&rdquo; The whole thickness of the
Cambrian rocks of Sweden does not exceed 300 feet from the
equivalents of the Tremadoc beds to these sandstones, which last
seem to correspond with the Longmynd, and are regarded by Torell as
older than any fossiliferous primordial rocks in Bohemia.</p>

<p><b>Cambrian of the United States and Canada</b> <i>(Potsdam
Sandstone).</i>&mdash;This formation, as we learn from Sir W.
Logan, is 700 feet thick in Canada; the upper part consists of
sandstone containing fucoids, and perforated by small vertical
holes, which are very characteristic of the rock, and appear to
have been made by annelids <i>(Scolithus linearis).</i> The lower
portion is a conglomerate with quartz pebbles. I have seen the
Potsdam sandstone on the banks of the St. Lawrence, and on the
borders of Lake Champlain, where, as at Keesville, it is a white
quartzose fine-grained grit, almost passing into quartzite. It is
divided into horizontal ripple-marked beds, very like those of the
Lingula Flags of Britain, and replete with a small round-shaped <i>
Obolella,</i> in such numbers as to divide the rock into parallel
planes, in the same manner as do the scales of mica in some
micaceous sandstones. Among the shells of this formation in
Wisconsin are species of <i>Lingula</i> and <i>Orthis,</i> and
several trilobites</p>

<p>of the primordial genus <i>Dikelocephalus</i> (Fig. 581). On the
banks of the St. Lawrence, near Beauharnois and elsewhere, many
fossil footprints have been observed on the surface of the rippled
layers. They are supposed by Professor Owen to be the trails of
more than one species of articulate animal, probably allied to the
King Crab, or <i>Limulus.</i></p>

<p>Recent investigations by the naturalists of the Canadian survey
have rendered it certain that below the level of the Potsdam
Sandstone there are slates and schists extending from New York to
Newfoundland, occupied by a series of trilobitic forms similar in
genera, though not in species, to those found in the European Upper
Cambrian strata.</p>

<p><b>Huronian Series.</b>&mdash;Next below the Upper Cambrian
occur strata called the Huronian by Sir W. Logan, which are of vast
thickness, consisting chiefly of quartzite, with great masses of
greenish chloritic slate, which sometimes include pebbles of
crystalline rocks derived from the Laurentian formation, next to be
described. Limestones are rare in this series, but one band of 300
feet in thickness has been traced for considerable distances to the
north of Lake Huron. Beds of greenstone are intercalated
conformably with the quartzose and argillaceous members of this
series. No organic remains have yet been found in any of the beds,
which are about 18,000 feet thick, and rest unconformably on the
Laurentian rocks.</p>

<br>
 

<center><small>LAURENTIAN &nbsp;GROUP.</small></center>

<p>In the course of the geological survey carried on under the
direction of Sir W.E. Logan, it has been shown that, northward of
the river St. Lawrence, there is a vast series of crystalline rocks
of gneiss, mica-schist, quartzite, and limestone, more than 30,000
feet in thickness, which have been called Laurentian, and which are
already known to occupy an area of about 200,000 square miles. They
are not only more ancient than the fossiliferous Cambrian
formations above described, but are older than the Huronian last
mentioned, and had undergone great disturbing movements before the
Potsdam sandstone and the other &ldquo;primordial&rdquo; or
Cambrian rocks were formed. The older half of this Laurentian
series is unconformable to the newer portion of the same.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 491">[ 491 ]</a></p>

<p><b>Upper Laurentian or Labrador Series.</b>&mdash;The Upper
Group, more than 10,000 feet thick, consists of stratified
crystalline rocks in which no organic remains have yet been found.
They consist in great part of feldspars, which vary in composition
from anorthite to andesine, or from those kinds in which there is
less than one per cent of potash and soda to those in which there
is more than seven per cent of these alkalies, the soda
preponderating greatly. These feldsparites sometimes form mountain
masses almost without any admixture of other minerals; but at other
times they include augite, which passes into hypersthene. They are
often granitoid in structure. One of the varieties is the same as
the apolescent labradorite rock of Labrador. The Adirondack
Mountains in the State of New York are referred to the same series,
and it is conjectured that the hypersthene rocks of Skye, which
resemble this formation in mineral character, may be of the same
geological age.</p>

<p><b>Lower Laurentian.</b>&mdash;This series, about 20,000 feet in
thickness, is, as before stated, unconformable to that last
mentioned; it consists in great part of gneiss of a reddish tint
with orthoclase feldspar. Beds of nearly pure quartz, from 400 to
600 feet thick, occur in some places. Hornblendic and micaceous
schists are often interstratified, and beds of limestone, usually
crystalline. Beds of plumbago also occur. That this pure carbon may
have been of organic origin before metamorphism has naturally been
conjectured.</p>

<p>There are several of these limestones which have been traced to
great distances, and one of them is from 700 to 1500 feet thick. In
the most massive of them Sir W. Logan observed, in 1859, what he
considered to be an organic body much resembling the Silurian
fossil called <i>Stromatopora rugosa.</i> It had been obtained the
year before by Mr. J. MacMullen at the Grand Calumet, on the river
Ottawa. This fossil was examined in 1864 by Dr. Dawson of Montreal,
who detected in it, by aid of the microscope, the distinct
structure of a Rhizopod or Foraminifer. Dr. Carpenter and Professor
T. Rupert Jones have since confirmed this opinion, comparing the
structure to that of the well-known nummulite. It appears to have
grown one layer over another, and to have formed reefs of limestone
as do the living coral-building polyp animals. Parts of the
original skeleton, consisting of carbonate of lime, are still
preserved; while certain inter-spaces in the calcareous fossil have
been filled up with serpentine and white augite. On this oldest of
known organic remains Dr. Dawson has conferred the name of <i>
Eozoon</i></p>

<p><i>Canadense</i> (see Figs. 582, 583); its antiquity is such
that the distance of time which separated it from the Upper
Cambrian period, or that of the Potsdam sandstone, may, says Sir W.
Logan, be equal to the time which elapsed between the Potsdam
sandstone and the nummulitic limestones of the Tertiary period. The
Laurentian and Huronian rocks united are about 50,000 feet in
thickness, and the Lower Laurentian was disturbed before the newer
series was deposited. We may naturally expect the other proofs of
unconformability will hereafter be detected at more than one point
in so vast a succession of strata.</p>

<p>The mineral character of the Upper Laurentian differs, as we
have seen, from that of the Lower, and the pebbles of gneiss in the
Huronian conglomerates are thought to prove that the Laurentian
strata were already in a metamorphic state before they were broken
up to supply materials for the Huronian. Even if we had not
discovered the Eozoon, we might fairly have inferred from analogy
that as the quartzites were once beds of sand, and the gneiss and
mica-schist derived from shales and argillaceous sandstones, so the
calcareous masses, from 400 to 1000 feet and more in thickness,
were originally of organic origin. This is now generally believed
to have been the case with the Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous,
Oolitic, and Cretaceous limestones and those nummulitic rocks of
tertiary date which bear the closest affinity to the Eozoon reefs
of the Lower Laurentian. The oldest stratified rock in Scotland is
that called by Sir R. Murchison</p>

<p>&ldquo;the fundamental gneiss,&rdquo; which is found in the
north-west of Ross-shire, and in Sutherlandshire (see <a href=
"images/fig82.jpg">Fig. 82</a>), and forms the whole of the
adjoining island of Lewis, in the Hebrides. It has a strike from
north-west to south-east, nearly at right angles to the metamorphic
strata of the Grampians. On this Laurentian gneiss, in parts of the
western Highlands, the Lower Cambrian and various metamorphic rocks
rest unconformably. It seems highly probable that this ancient
gneiss of Scotland may correspond in date with part of the great
Laurentian group of North America.</p>
