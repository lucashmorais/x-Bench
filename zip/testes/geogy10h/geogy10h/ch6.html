<p>Denudation, which has been occasionally spoken of in the
preceding chapters, is the removal of solid matter by water in
motion, whether of rivers or of the waves and currents of the sea,
and the consequent laying bare of some inferior rock. This
operation has exerted an influence on the structure of the earth&rsquo;s
crust as universal and important as sedimentary deposition itself;
for denudation is the necessary antecedent of the production of all
new strata of mechanical origin. The formation of every new deposit
by the transport of sediment and pebbles necessarily implies that
there has been, somewhere else, a grinding down of rock into
rounded fragments, sand, or mud, equal in quantity to the new
strata. All deposition, therefore, except in the case of a shower
of volcanic ashes, and the outflow of lava, and the growth of
certain organic formations, is the sign of superficial waste going
on contemporaneously, and to an equal amount, elsewhere. The gain
at one point is no more than sufficient to balance the loss at some
other. Here a lake has grown shallower, there a ravine has been
deepened. Here the depth of the sea has been augmented by the
removal of a sandbank during a storm, there its bottom has been
raised and shallowed by the accumulation in its bed of the same
sand transported from the bank.</p>

<p>When we see a stone building, we know that somewhere, far or
near, a quarry has been opened. The courses of stone in the
building may be compared to successive strata, the quarry to a
ravine or valley which has suffered denudation. As the strata, like
the courses of hewn stone, have been laid one upon another
gradually, so the excavation both of the valley and quarry have
been gradual. To pursue the comparison still farther, the
superficial heaps of mud, sand, and gravel, usually called
alluvium, may be likened to the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 97">[ 97 ]</a></p>

<p>rubbish of a quarry which has been rejected as useless by the
workmen, or has fallen upon the road between the quarry and the
building, so as to lie scattered at random over the ground.</p>

<p>But we occasionally find in a conglomerate large rounded pebbles
of an older conglomerate, which had previously been derived from a
variety of different rocks. In such cases we are reminded that, the
same materials having been used over and over again, it is not
enough to affirm that the entire mass of stratified deposits in the
earth&rsquo;s crust affords a monument and measure of the denudation
which has taken place, for in truth the quantity of matter now
extant in the form of stratified rock represents but a fraction of
the material removed by water and redeposited in past ages.</p>

<p><b>Suba&euml;rial
Denudation.</b>&mdash;Denudation may be divided into
suba&euml;rial, or the action of wind, rain, and rivers; and
submarine, or that effected by the waves of the sea, and its tides
and currents. With the operation of the first of these we are best
acquainted, and it may be well to give it our first attention.</p>

<p><i>Action of the Wind.</i>&mdash;In desert regions where no rain
falls, or where, as in parts of the Sahara, the soil is so salt as
to be without any covering of vegetation, clouds of dust and sand
attest the power of the wind to cause the shifting of the
unconsolidated or disintegrated rock.</p>

<p>In examining volcanic countries I have been much struck with the
great superficial changes brought about by this power in the course
of centuries. The highest peak of Madeira is about 6050 feet above
the sea, and consists of the skeleton of a volcanic cone now 250
feet high, the beds of which once dipped from a centre in all
directions at an angle of more than 30&deg;. The summit is formed
of a dike of basalt with much olivine, fifteen feet wide,
apparently the remains of a column of lava which once rose to the
crater. Nearly all the scori&aelig; of the upper part of the cone
have been swept away, those portions only remaining which were
hardened by the contact or proximity of the dike. While I was
myself on this peak on January 25, 1854, I saw the wind, though it
was not stormy weather, removing sand and dust derived from the
decomposing scori&aelig;. There had been frost in the night, and
some ice was still seen in the crevices of the rock.</p>

<p>On the highest platform of the Grand Canary, at an elevation of
6000 feet, there is a cylindrical column of hard lava, from which
the softer matter has been carried away; and other similar remnants
of the dikes of cones of eruption</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 98">[ 98 ]</a></p>

<p>attest the denuding power of the wind at points where running
water could never have exerted any influence. The waste effected by
wind aided by frost and snow, may not be trifling, even in a single
winter, and when multiplied by centuries may become indefinitely
great.</p>

<center><img src="images/fig80.jpg" width="367" height="126" alt=
"Fig. 80: Section through several eroded formations."></center>

<p><i>Action of Running Water.</i>&mdash;There are different
classes of phenomena which attest in a most striking manner the
vast spaces left vacant by the erosive power of water. I may
allude, first, to those valleys on both sides of which the same
strata are seen following each other in the same order, and having
the same mineral composition and fossil contents. We may observe,
for example, several formations, as Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, in the diagram
(Fig. 80): No. 1, conglomerate, No. 2, clay, No. 3, grit, and No.
4, limestone, each repeated in a series of hills separated by
valleys varying in depth. When we examine the subordinate parts of
these four formations, we find, in like manner, distinct beds in
each, corresponding, on the opposite sides of the valleys, both in
composition and order of position. No one can doubt that the strata
were originally continuous, and that some cause has swept away the
portions which once connected the whole series. A torrent on the
side of a mountain produces similar interruptions; and when we make
artificial cuts in lowering roads, we expose, in like manner,
corresponding beds on either side. But in nature, these appearances
occur in mountains several thousand feet high, and separated by
intervals of many miles or leagues in extent.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Great Britain&rdquo; (vol.
i), Professor Ramsay has shown that the missing beds, removed from
the summit of the Mendips, must have been nearly a mile in
thickness; and he has pointed out considerable areas in South Wales
and some of the adjacent counties of England, where a series of
primary (or pal&aelig;ozoic) strata, no less than 11,000 feet in
thickness, have been stripped off. All these materials have of
course been transported to new regions, and have entered into the
composition of more modern formations. On the other hand, it is
shown by</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 99">[ 99 ]</a></p>

<p>observations in the same &ldquo;Survey,&rdquo; that the Pal&aelig;ozoic
strata are from 20,000 to 30,000 feet thick. It is clear that such
rocks, formed of mud and sand, now for the most part consolidated,
are the monuments of denuding operations, which took place on a
grand scale at a very remote period in the earth&rsquo;s history. For,
whatever has been given to one area must always have been borrowed
from another; a truth which, obvious as it may seem when thus
stated, must be repeatedly impressed on the student&rsquo;s mind, because
in many geological speculations it is taken for granted that the
external crust of the earth has been always growing thicker in
consequence of the accumulation, period after period, of
sedimentary matter, as if the new strata were not always produced
at the expense of pre-existing rocks, stratified or unstratified.
By duly reflecting on the fact that all deposits of mechanical
origin imply the transportation from some other region, whether
contiguous or remote, of an equal amount of solid matter, we
perceive that the stony exterior of the planet must always have
grown thinner in one place, whenever, by accessions of new strata,
it was acquiring thickness in another.</p>

<p>It is well known that generally at the mouths of large rivers,
deltas are forming and the land is encroaching upon the sea; these
deltas are monuments of recent denudation and deposition; and it is
obvious that if the mud, sand, and gravel were taken from them and
restored to the continents they would fill up a large part of the
gullies and valleys which are due to the excavating and
transporting power of torrents and rivers.</p>

<p><b>Alluvium.</b>&mdash;Between the
superficial covering of vegetable mould and the subjacent rock
there usually intervenes in every district a deposit of loose
gravel, sand, and mud, to which when it occurs in valleys the name
of alluvium has been popularly applied. The term is derived from
<i>alluvio</i>, an inundation, or <i>alluo</i>, to wash, because
the pebbles and sand commonly resemble those of a river&rsquo;s bed or
the mud and gravel washed over low lands by a flood.</p>

<p>In the course of those changes in physical geography which may
take place during the gradual emergence of the bottom of the sea
and its conversion into dry land, any spot may either have been a
sunken reef, or a bay, or estuary, or sea-shore, or the bed of a
river. The drainage, moreover, may have been deranged again and
again by earthquakes, during which temporary lakes are caused by
landslips, and partial deluges occasioned by the bursting of the
barriers of such lakes. For this reason it would be unreasonable
to</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 100">[ 100 ]</a></p>

<p>hope that we should ever be able to account for all the alluvial
phenomena of each particular country, seeing that the causes of
their origin are so various. Besides, the last operations of water
have a tendency to disturb and confound together all pre-existing
alluviums. Hence we are always in danger of regarding as the work
of a single era, and the effect of one cause, what has in reality
been the result of a variety of distinct agents, during a long
succession of geological epochs. Much useful instruction may
therefore be gained from the exploration of a country like
Auvergne, where the superficial gravel of very different eras
happens to have been preserved and kept separate by sheets of lava,
which were poured out one after the other at periods when the
denudation, and probably the upheaval, of rocks were in progress.
That region had already acquired in some degree its present
configuration before any volcanoes were in activity, and before any
igneous matter was superimposed upon the granitic and fossiliferous
formations. The pebbles therefore in the older gravels are
exclusively constituted of granite and other aboriginal rocks; and
afterwards, when volcanic vents burst forth into eruption, those
earlier alluviums were covered by streams of lava, which protected
them from intermixture with gravel of subsequent date. In the
course of ages, a new system of valleys was excavated, so that the
rivers ran at lower levels than those at which the first alluviums
and sheets of lava were formed. When, therefore, fresh eruptions
gave rise to new lava, the melted matter was poured out over lower
grounds; and the gravel of these plains differed from the first or
upland alluvium, by containing in it rounded fragments of various
volcanic rocks, and often fossil bones belonging to species of land
animals different from those which had previously flourished in the
same country and been buried in older gravels.</p>

<center><img src="images/fig81.jpg" width="372" height="125" alt=
"Fig. 81: Lavas of Auvergne resting on alluviums of different ages.">
</center>

<p>The annexed drawing (Fig. 81) will explain the different heights
at which beds of lava and gravel, each distinct from the other in
composition and age, are observed, some on the flat tops of hills,
700 or 800 feet high, others on the slope of</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 101">[ 101 ]</a></p>

<p>the same hills, and the newest of all in the channel of the
existing river where there is usually gravel alone, although in
some cases a narrow strip of solid lava shares the bottom of the
valley with the river.</p>

<p>The proportion of extinct species of quadrupeds is more numerous
in the fossil remains of the gravel No. 1 than in that indicated as
No. 2; and in No. 3 they agree more closely, sometimes entirely,
with those of the existing fauna. The usual absence or rarity of
organic remains in beds of loose gravel and sand is partly owing to
the friction which originally ground down the rocks into small
fragments, and partly to the porous nature of alluvium, which
allows the free percolation through it of rain-water, and promotes
the decomposition and removal of fossil remains.</p>

<p>The loose transported matter on the surface of a large part of
the land now existing in the temperate and arctic regions of the
northern hemisphere, must be regarded as being in a somewhat
exceptional state, in consequence of the important part which ice
has played in comparatively modern geological times. This subject
will be more specially alluded to when we describe, in the eleventh
chapter, the deposits called &ldquo;glacial.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Denuding Power of Rivers affected by Rise
or Fall of Land.</b>&mdash;It has long been a matter of
common observation that most rivers are now cutting their channels
through alluvial deposits of greater depth and extent than could
ever have been formed by the present streams. From this fact it has
been inferred that rivers in general have grown smaller, or become
less liable to be flooded than formerly. It may be true that in the
history of almost every country the rivers have been both larger
and smaller than they are at the present moment. For the rainfall
in particular regions varies according to climate and physical
geography, and is especially governed by the elevation of the land
above the sea, or its distance from it and other conditions equally
fluctuating in the course of time. But the phenomenon alluded to
may sometimes be accounted for by oscillations in the level of the
land, experienced since the existing valleys originated, even where
no marked diminution in the quantity of rain and in the size of the
rivers has occurred.</p>

<p>We know that many large areas of land are rising and others
sinking, and unless it could be assumed that both the upward and
downward movements are everywhere uniform, many of the existing
hydrographical basins ought to have the appearance of having been
temporary lakes first filled with fluviatile strata and then
partially re-excavated.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 102">[ 102 ]</a></p>

<p>Suppose, for example, part of a continent, comprising within it
a large hydrographical basin like that of the Mississippi, to
subside several inches or feet in a century, as the west coast of
Greenland, extending 600 miles north and south, has been sinking
for three or four centuries, between the latitudes 60&deg; and
69&deg; N.* It will rarely happen that the rate of subsidence will
be everywhere equal, and in many cases the amount of depression in
the interior will regularly exceed that of the region nearer the
sea. Whenever this happens, the fall of the waters flowing from the
upland country will be diminished, and each tributary stream will
have less power to carry its sand and sediment into the main river,
and the main river less power to convey its annual burden of
transported matter to the sea. All the rivers, therefore, will
proceed to fill up partially their ancient channels, and, during
frequent inundations, will raise their alluvial plains by new
deposits. If then the same area of land be again upheaved to its
former height, the fall, and consequently the velocity, of every
river will begin to augment. Each of them will be less given to
overflow its alluvial plain; and their power of carrying earthy
matter seaward, and of scouring out and deepening their channels,
will be sustained till, after a lapse of many thousand years, each
of them has eroded a new channel or valley through a fluviatile
formation of comparatively modern date. The surface of what was
once the river-plain at the period of greatest depression, will
then remain fringing the valley-sides in the form of a terrace
apparently flat, but in reality sloping down with the general
inclination of the river. Everywhere this terrace will present
cliffs of gravel and sand, facing the river. That such a series of
movements has actually taken place in the main valley of the
Mississippi and in its tributary valleys during oscillations of
level, I have endeavoured to show in my description of that
country;&dagger; and the fresh-water shells of existing species and
bones of land quadrupeds, partly of extinct races, preserved in the
terraces of fluviatile origin, attest the exclusion of the sea
during the whole process of filling up and partial
re-excavation.</p>

<p><b>Littoral Denudation.</b>&mdash;Part
of the action of the waves between high and low watermark must be
included in suba&euml;rial denudation, more especially as the
undermining of cliffs by the waves is facilitated by land-springs,
and these often lead to the sliding down of great masses of land
into the sea. Along our coasts we find numerous submerged
forests,</p>

<p class="fnote">* Principles of Geology 7th ed., p. 506; 10th ed.,
vol. ii, p. 196.<br>
&dagger; Second Visit to the United States, vol. i, chap.
xxxiv.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 103">[ 103 ]</a></p>

<p>only visible at low water, having the trunks of the trees erect
and their roots attached to them and still spreading through the
ancient soil as when they were living. They occur in too many
places, and sometimes at too great a depth, to be explained by a
mere change in the level of the tides, although as the coasts waste
away and alter in shape, the height to which the tides rise and
fall is always varying, and the level of high tide at any given
point may, in the course of many ages, differ by several feet or
even fathoms. It is this fluctuation in the height of the tides,
and the erosion and destruction of the sea-coast by the waves, that
makes it exceedingly difficult for us in a few centuries, or even
perhaps in a few thousand years, to determine whether there is a
change by subterranean movement in the relative level of sea and
land.</p>

<p>We often behold, as on the coasts of Devonshire and
Pembrokeshire, facts which appear to lead to opposite conclusions.
In one place a raised beach with marine littoral shells, and in
another immediately adjoining a submerged forest. These phenomena
indicate oscillations of level, and as the movements are very
gradual, they must give repeated opportunities to the breakers to
denude the land which is thus again and again exposed to their
fury, although it is evident that the submergence is sometimes
effected in such a manner as to allow the trees which border the
coast not to be carried away.</p>

<p><b>Inland Sea-cliffs.</b>&mdash;In
countries where hard limestone rocks abound, inland cliffs have
often retained faithfully for ages the characters which they
acquired when they constituted the boundary of land and sea. Thus,
in the Morea, no less than three or even four ranges of cliffs are
well-preserved, rising one above the other at different distances
from the actual shore, the summit of the highest and oldest
occasionally attaining 1000 feet in elevation. A consolidated beach
with marine shells is usually found at the base of each cliff, and
a line of littoral caverns. These ranges of cliff probably imply
pauses in the process of upheaval when the waves and currents had
time to undermine and clear away considerable masses of rock.</p>

<p>But the beginner should be warned not to expect to find evidence
of the former sojourn of the sea on all those lands which we are
nevertheless sure have been submerged at periods comparatively
modern; for notwithstanding the enduring nature of the marks left
by littoral action on some rocks, especially limestones, we can by
no means detect sea-beaches and inland cliffs everywhere. On the
contrary, they</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 104">[ 104 ]</a></p>

<p>are, upon the whole, extremely partial, and are often entirely
wanting in districts composed of argillaceous and sandy formations,
which must, nevertheless, have been upheaved at the same time, and
by the same intermittent movements, as the adjoining harder
rocks.</p>

<p><b>Escarpments.</b>&mdash;Besides the
inland cliffs above alluded to which mark the ancient limits of the
sea, there are other abrupt terminations of rocks of various kinds
which resemble sea-cliffs, but which have in reality been due to
suba&euml;rial denudation. These have been called &ldquo;escarpments,&rdquo; a
term which it is useful to confine to the outcrop of particular
formations having a scarped outline, as distinct from cliffs due to
marine action.</p>

<p>I formerly supposed that the steep line of cliff-like slopes
seen along the outcrop of the chalk, when we follow the edge of the
North or South Downs, was due to marine action; but Professor
Ramsay has shown* that the present outline of the physical
geography is more in favour of the idea of the escarpments having
been due to gradual waste since the rocks were exposed in the
atmosphere to the action of rain and rivers.</p>

<p>Mr. Whittaker has given a good summary of the grounds for
ascribing these apparent sea-cliffs to waste in the open air. 1.
There is an absence of all signs of ancient sea-beaches or littoral
deposits at the base of the escarpment. 2. Great inequality is
observed in the level of the base line. 3. The escarpments do not
intersect, like sea-cliffs, a series of distinct rocks, but are
always confined to the boundary-line of the same formation. 4.
There are sometimes different contiguous and parallel
escarpments&mdash;those, for example, of the greensand and
chalk&mdash;which are so near each other, and occasionally so
similar in altitude, that we can not imagine any existing
archipelago if converted into dry land to present a like
outline.</p>

<p>The above theory is by no means inconsistent with the opinion
that the limits of the outcrop of the chalk and greensand which the
escarpments now follow, were originally determined by marine
denudation. When the south-east of England last emerged from
beneath the level of the sea, it was acted upon, no doubt, by the
tide, waves, and currents, and the chalk would form from the first
a mass projecting above the more destructible clay called Gault.
Still the present escarpments so much resembling sea-cliffs have no
doubt, for reasons above stated, derived their most characteristic
features subsequently to emergence from suba&euml;rial waste by
rain and rivers.</p>

<p><b>Submarine
Denudation.</b>&mdash;When we attempt to estimate the amount
of submarine denudation, we become sensible of the disadvantage
under which we labour from our habitual incapacity of observing the
action of marine currents on the bed of the sea. We know that the
agitation of the waves, even during storms, diminishes at a rapid
rate, so as to become very insignificant at the depth of a few
fathoms, and is quite imperceptible at the depth of about sixteen
fathoms; but when large bodies of water are transferred by a
current from one part of the ocean to another, they are known to
maintain at great depths such a velocity as must enable them to
remove the finer, and sometimes even the coarser, materials of the
rocks over which they flow. As the Mississippi when more than 150
feet deep can keep open its channel and even carry down gravel and
sand to its delta, the surface velocity being not more than two or
three miles an hour, so a gigantic current, like the Gulf Stream,
equal in volume to many hundred Mississippis, and having in parts a
surface velocity of more than three miles, may act as a propelling
and abrading power at still greater depths. But the efficacy of the
sea as a denuding agent, geologically considered, is not dependent
on the power of currents to preserve at great depths a velocity
sufficient to remove sand and mud, because, even where the
deposition or removal of sediment is not in progress, the depth of
water does not remain constant throughout geological time. Every
page of the geological record proves to us that the relative levels
of land and sea, and the position of the ocean and of continents
and islands, has been always varying, and we may feel sure that
some portions of the submarine area are now rising and others
sinking. The force of tidal and other currents and of the waves
during storms is sufficient to prevent the emergence of many lands,
even though they may be undergoing continual upheaval. It is not an
uncommon error to imagine that the waste of sea-cliffs affords the
measure of the amount of marine denudation of which it probably
constitutes an insignificant portion.</p>

<p><b>Dogger-bank.</b>&mdash;That great
shoal called the Dogger-bank, about sixty miles east of the coast
of Northumberland, and occupying an area about as large as Wales,
has nowhere a depth of more than ninety feet, and in its shallower
parts is less than forty feet under water. It might contribute
towards the safety of the navigation of our seas to form an
artificial island, and to erect a light-house on this bank; but no
engineer would be rash enough to attempt it, as he would feel sure
that the ocean in the first heavy gale would</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 106">[ 106 ]</a></p>

<p>sweep it away as readily as it does every temporary shoal that
accumulates from time to time around a sunk vessel on the same
bank.*</p>

<p>No observed geographical changes in historical times entitle us
to assume that where upheaval may be in progress it proceeds at a
rapid rate. Three or four feet rather than as many yards in a
century may probably be as much as we can reckon upon in our
speculations; and if such be the case, the continuance of the
upward movement might easily be counteracted by the denuding force
of such currents aided by such waves as, during a gale, are known
to prevail in the German Ocean. What parts of the bed of the ocean
are stationary at present, and what areas may be rising or sinking,
is a matter of which we are very ignorant, as the taking of
accurate soundings is but of recent date.</p>

<p><i>Newfoundland Bank.</i>&mdash;The great bank of Newfoundland
may be compared in size to the whole of England. This part of the
bottom of the Atlantic is surrounded on three sides by a rapidly
deepening ocean, the bank itself being from twenty to fifty fathoms
(or from 120 to 300 feet) under water. We are unable to determine
by the comparison of different charts made at distant periods,
whether it is undergoing any change of level, but if it be
gradually rising we can not anticipate on that account that it will
become land, because the breakers in an open sea would exercise a
prodigious force even on solid rock brought up to within a few
yards of the surface. We know, for example, that when a new
volcanic island rose in the Mediterranean in 1831, the waves were
capable in a few years of reducing it to a sunken rock.</p>

<p>In the same way currents which flow over the Newfoundland bank a
great part of the year at the rate of two miles an hour, and are
known to retain a considerable velocity to near the bottom, may
carry away all loose sand and mud, and make the emergence of the
shoal impossible, in spite of the accessions of mud, sand, and
boulders derived occasionally from melting icebergs which, coming
from the northern glaciers, are frequently stranded on various
parts of the bank. They must often leave at the bottom large
erratic blocks which the marine currents may be incapable of
moving, but the same rocky fragments may be made to sink by the
undermining of beds consisting of finer matter on which the blocks
and gravel repose. In this way gravel and boulders may continue to
overspread a submarine bottom after the latter has been lowered for
hundreds of feet, the</p>

by no means improbable that the annual removal of an average
thickness of half an inch of rock might counteract the ordinary
upheaval which large submarine areas are undergoing; and the real
enigma which the geologist has to solve is not the extensive
denudation of the white chalk or of our tertiary sands and clays,
but the fact that such incoherent materials have ever succeeded in
lifting up their heads above water in an open sea. Why were they
not swept away during storms into some adjoining abysses, the
highest parts of each shoal being always planed off down to the
depth of a few fathoms? The hardness and toughness of some rocks
already exposed to windward and acting as breakwaters may perhaps
have assisted; nor must we forget the protection afforded by a
dense and unbroken covering of barnacles, limpets, and other
creatures which flourish most between high and low water and
shelter some newly risen coasts from the waves.</p>
