<p><b>Vegetation of the Coal Period.</b>&mdash;In the last chapter
we have seen that the seams of coal, whether bituminous or
anthracitic, are derived from the same species of plants, and
Goppert has ascertained that the remains of every family of plants
scattered through the shales and sandstones of the coal-measures
are sometimes met with in the pure coal itself&mdash;a fact which adds
greatly to the geological interest of this flora.</p>

<p>The coal-period was called by Adolphe Brongniart the age of
Acrogens,* so great appears to have been the numerical
preponderance of flowerless or cryptogamic plants of the families
of ferns, club-mosses, and horse-tails. He reckoned the known
species in 1849 at 500, and the number has been largely increased
by recent research in spite of reductions owing to the discovery
that different parts of even the same plants had been taken for
distinct species. Notwithstanding these changes, Brongniart&rsquo;s
generalisation concerning this flora still holds true, namely, that
the state of the vegetable world was then extremely different from
that now prevailing, not only because the cryptogamous plants
constituted nearly the whole flora, but also because they were, on
the whole, more highly developed than any belonging to the same
class now existing, and united some forms of structure now only
found separately and in distinct orders. The only ph&aelig;nogamous
plants were constitute any feature in the coal are the
conifer&aelig;; monocotyledonous angiosperms appear to have been
very rare, and the dicotyledonous, with one or two doubtful
exceptions, were wanting. For this we are in some measure prepared
by what we have seen of the Secondary or Mesozoic floras if,
consistently with the belief in the theory of evolution, we expect
to find the prevalence of simpler and less specialised organisms in
older rocks.</p>

<p><b>Ferns.</b>&mdash;We are struck at the first glance with the
similarity of the ferns to those now living. In the fossil genus
<i>Pecopteris,</i> for example (Fig. 448), it is not easy to decide
whether the fossils might not be referred to the same genera as
those established for living ferns; whereas, in regard to some of
the other contemporary families of plants, with the exception of
the fir tribe, it is not easy to guess even the class to which they
belong. The ferns of the Carboniferous period are generally without
organs of fructification, but in the few instances in which these
do occur in a fit state for microscopical investigations they agree
with those of the living ferns.</p>

<center><img src="images3/fig448.jpg" width="386" height="291" alt=
"Fig. 448: Pecopteris elliptica. Fig. 449: Caulopteris prim&aelig;va.">
</center>

<p>When collecting fossil specimens from the coal-measures of
Frostburg, in Maryland, I found in the iron-shales several species
with well-preserved rounded spots or marks of the sori (see Fig.
448). In the general absence of such characters they have been
divided into genera distinguished chiefly by the branching of the
fronds and the way in which the veins of the leaves are disposed.
The larger portion are supposed to have been of the size of
ordinary European ferns, but some were decidedly arborescent,
especially the group called <i>Caulopteris</i> (see Fig. 449) by
Lindley, and the <i>Psaronius</i> of the upper or newest
coal-measures, before alluded to (<a href="ch22.html#page 393">p.
393</a>). All the recent tree-ferns belong to one tribe
(<i>Polypodiace&aelig;</i>), and to a small number only of genera
in that tribe, in which the surface of the trunk is marked with
scars,</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 422">[ 422 ]</a></p>

<p>or cicatrices, left after the fall of the fronds. These scars
resemble those of <i>Caulopteris.</i></p>

<p>No less than 130 species of ferns are enumerated as having been
obtained from the British coal-strata, and this number is more than
doubled if we include the Continental and American species. Even if
we make some reduction on the ground of varieties which have been
mistaken, in the absence of their fructification, for species,
still the result is singular, because the whole of Europe affords
at present no more than sixty-seven indigenous species.</p>

</center>

<p><b>
Lycopodiace&aelig;</b>&mdash;<i>Lepidodendron.</i>&mdash;About
forty species of fossil plants of the Coal have been referred to
this genus, more than half of which are found in the British
coal-measures. They consist of cylindrical stems or trunks, covered
with leaf-scars. In their mode of branching, they are always
dichotomous (see <a href="images3/fig453.jpg">Fig. 454</a>). They
belong to the <i>Lycopodiace&aelig;,</i> bearing sporangia and
spores similar to those of the living representatives of this
family (<a href="images3/fig457.jpg">Fig. 457</a>); and although
most of the Carboniferous species grew to the size of large trees,
Mr. Carruthers has found by careful measurement that the volume of
the fossil spores did not exceed that of the recent club-moss, a
fact of some geological importance, as it may help to explain the
facility with which these seeds may</p>

distribution of the species of the fossil forests in Europe and
America which we now observe in the geographical distribution of so
many living families of cryptogamous plants.</p>

<p>The Figs. 453&ndash;455 represent a fossil <i>Lepidodendron,</i>
49 feet long, found in Jarrow Colliery, near Newcastle, lying in
shale parallel to the planes of stratification. Fragments of
others, found in the same shale, indicate, by the size of the
rhomboidal scars which cover them, a still greater magnitude.</p>

<p>The living club-mosses, of which there are about 200 species,
are most abundant in tropical climates. They usually creep on the
ground, but some stand erect, as the <i>Lycopodium densum</i> from
New Zealand (see Fig. 456), which attains a height of three
feet.</p>

</center>

<p>In the Carboniferous strata of Coalbrook Dale, and in many other
coal-fields, elongated cylindrical bodies, called fossil cones,
named <i>Lepidostrobus</i> by M. Adolphe Brongniart, are met with.
(See Fig. 457.) They often form the nucleus of concretionary balls
of clay-ironstone, and are well preserved, exhibiting a conical
axis, around which a great quantity of scales were compactly
imbricated. The opinion of M. Brongniart that the <i>
Lepidostrobus</i> is the fruit of <i>Lepidodendron</i> has been
confirmed, for these <i>strobili</i> or fruits have been found
terminating the tip of a branch of a well-characterised <i>
Lepidodendron</i> in Coalbrook Dale and elsewhere.</p>

</center>

<p><b>Equisetace&aelig;.</b>&mdash;To this family belong two fossil
genera of the coal, <i>Equisetites</i> and <i>Calamites.</i> The
Calamites were evidently closely related to the modern horse-tails
(Equiseta) differing principally in their great size, the want of
sheaths at the joints, and some details of fructification. They
grew in dense brakes on sandy and muddy flats in the manner of
modern Equisetace&aelig;, and their remains are frequent in the</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 425">[ 425 ]</a></p>

<p>coal. Seven species of this plant occur in the great Nova Scotia
section before described, where the stems of some of them five
inches in diameter, and sometimes eight feet high, may be seen
terminating downward in a tapering root (see Fig. 460).</p>

<center><img src="images3/fig460.jpg" width="408" height="233" alt=
"Fig. 460: Radical termination of a Calamite. Fig. 461: Asterophyllites foliosus, Coal-measures, Newcastle.">
</center>

<p>Botanists are not yet agreed whether the <i>Asterophyllites,</i>
a species of which is represented in Fig. 461, can form a separate
genus from the Calamite, from which, however, according to Dr.
Dawson, its foliage is distinguished by a true mid-rib, which is
wanting in the leaves known to belong to some Calamites.</p>

<img src="images3/fig462.jpg" width="95" height="176" alt=

"images3/fig463.jpg" width="92" height="166" alt=
"Fig. 463: Sphenophyllum erosum." align="right"> 

<p>Figs. 462 and 463 represent leaves of <i>Annularia</i> and <i>
Sphenophyllum,</i> common in the coal, and believed by Mr.
Carruthers to be leaves of Calamites. Dr. Williamson, who has
carefully studied the Calamites, thinks that they had a fistular
pith, exogenous woody stem, and thick smooth bark, which last
having always disappeared, leaves a fluted stem, as represented in
Fig. 459.</p>

<p><b>Sigillaria.</b>&mdash;A large portion of the trees of the
Carboniferous period belonged to this genus, of which as many as 28
species are enumerated as British. The structure, both internal and
external, was very peculiar, and, with reference to existing types,
very anomalous. They were formerly referred, by M. Ad. Brongniart,
to ferns, which they resemble in the scalariform texture of their
vessels and, in</p>

<p>some degree, in the form of the cicatrices left by the base of
the leaf-stalks which have fallen off (see Fig. 464). But some of
them are ascertained to have had long linear leaves, quite unlike
those of ferns. They grew to a great height, from 30 to 60, or even
70 feet, with regular cylindrical stems, and without branches,
although some species were dichotomous towards the top. Their
fluted trunks, from one to five feet in diameter, appear to have
decayed more rapidly in the interior than externally, so that they
became hollow when standing; and when thrown prostrate, they were
squeezed down and flattened. Hence, we find the bark of the two
opposite sides (now converted into bright shining coal) constitute
two horizontal layers, one upon the other, half an inch, or an
inch, in their united thickness. These same trunks, when they are
placed obliquely or vertically to the planes of stratification,
retain their original rounded form, and are uncompressed, the
cylinder of bark having been filled with sand, which now affords a
cast of the interior.</p>

<p>Dr. Hooker inclined to the belief that the <i>
Sigillari&aelig;</i> may have been cryptogamous, though more highly
developed than any flowerless plants now living. Dr. Dawson having
found in some species what he regards as medullary rays, thinks
with Brongniart that they have some relation to gymnogens, while
Mr. Carruthers leans to the opinion that they belong to the
Lycopodiace&aelig;.</p>

<p><i>Stigmaria.</i>&mdash;This fossil, the importance of which has
already been pointed out in <a href="ch23.html#page 398">p.
398</a>, was originally conjectured to be an aquatic plant. It is
now ascertained to be the root of <i>Sigillaria.</i> The connection
of the roots with the stem, previously suspected, on botanical
grounds, by Brongniart, was first proved, by actual contact, in the
Lancashire coal-field, by Mr. Binney. The fact has lately been
shown, even more distinctly, by Mr. Richard Brown, in his
description of the <i>Stigmari&aelig;</i> occurring in the
under-clays of the coal-seams of the Island of Cape Breton, in Nova
Scotia. In a specimen of one of these, represented in Fig. 465, the
spread of the roots was sixteen feet, and some of them sent out
rootlets, in all directions, into the surrounding clay.</p>

<center><img src="images3/fig465.jpg" width="365" height="176" alt=
"Fig. 465: Stigmaria attached to a trunk of Sigillaria."></center>

<p>In the sea-cliffs of the South Joggins in Nova Scotia, I
examined several erect <i>Sigillari&aelig;,</i> in company with Dr.
Dawson, and we found that from the lower extremities of the trunk
they sent out <i>Stigmari&aelig;</i> as roots. All the stools of
the fossil trees dug out by us divided into four parts, and these
again bifurcated, forming eight roots, which were also dichotomous
when traceable far enough. The cylindrical rootlets formerly
regarded as leaves are now shown by more perfect specimens to have
been attached to the root by fitting into deep cylindrical pits. In
the fossil there is rarely any trace of the form of these cavities,
in consequence of the shrinkage of the surrounding tissues. Where
the rootlets are removed, nothing remains on the surface of the
Stigmaria but rows of mammillated tubercles (see Figs. 466, 467),
which have formed the base of each rootlet.</p>

<center><img src="images3/fig466.jpg" width="440" height="202" alt=
"Fig. 466: Stigmaria ficoides. Fig. 467: Surface of another individual of same species, showing form of tubercles.">
</center>

<p>These protuberances may possibly indicate the place of a joint
at the lower extremity of the rootlet. Rows of these tubercles are
arranged spirally round each root, which have always a medullary
axis and woody system much resembling that of <i>Sigillaria,</i>
the structure of the vessels being, like it, scalariform.</p>

<p><b>Conifer&aelig;.</b>&mdash;The coniferous trees of this period
are referred to five genera;</p>

<p>the woody structure of some of them showing that they were
allied to the Araucarian division of pines, more than to any of our
common European firs. Some of their trunks exceeded forty-four feet
in height. Many, if not all of them, seem to have differed from
living <i>Conifer&aelig;</i> in having large piths; for Professor
Williamson has demonstrated the fossil of the coal-measures called
<i>Sternbergia</i> to be the pith of these trees, or rather the
cast of cavities formed by the shrinking or partial absorption of
the original medullary axis (see Figs. 468, 469). This peculiar
type of pith is observed in living plants of very different
families, such as the common Walnut and the White Jasmine, in which
the pith becomes so reduced as simply to form a thin lining of the
medullary cavity, across which transverse plates of pith extend
horizontally, so as to divide the cylindrical hollow into discoid
interspaces. When these interspaces have been filled up with
inorganic matter, they constitute an axis to which, before their
true nature was known, the provisional name of <i>Sternbergia</i>
(<i>d, d,</i> Fig. 468) was given. In the above specimen the
structure of the wood (<i>b,</i> Figs. 468 and 469) is coniferous,
and the fossil is referable to Endlicher&rsquo;s fossil genus <i>
Dadoxylon.</i></p>

<p>The fossil named <i>Trigonocarpon</i> (Figs. 470 and 471),
formerly supposed to be the fruit of a palm, may now, according to
Dr. Hooker, be referred, like the <i>Sternbergia,</i> to the <i>
Conifer&aelig;.</i> Its geological importance is great, for so
abundant is it in the coal-measures, that in certain localities the
fruit of</p>

<p>some species may be procured by the bushel; nor is there any
part of the formation where they do not occur, except the
under-clays and limestone. The sandstone, ironstone, shales, and
coal itself, all contain them. Mr. Binney has at length found in
the clay-ironstone of Lancashire several specimens displaying
structure, and from these, says Dr. Hooker, we learn that the <i>
Trigonocarpon</i> belonged to that large section of existing
coniferous plants which bear fleshy solitary fruits, and not cones.
It resembled very closely the fruit of the Chinese genus <i>
Salisburia,</i> one of the Yew tribe, or Taxoid conifers.</p>

<img src="images3/fig472.jpg" width="107" height="229" alt=
"Fig. 472: Antholithes." align="right"> 

<p><b>Angiosperms.</b>&mdash;The curious fossils called <i>
Antholithes</i> by Lindley have usually been considered to be
flower spikes, having what seems a calyx and linear petals (see
Fig. 472). Dr. Hooker, after seeing very perfect specimens, also
thought that they resembled the spike of a highly-organised plant
in full flower, such as one of the <i>Bromeliace&aelig;,</i> to
which Professor Lindley had at first compared them. Mr. Carruthers,
who has lately examined a large series in different museums,
considers it to be a dicotyledonous angiosperm allied to <i>
Orobanche</i> (broom-rape), which grew, not on the soil, but
parasitically on the trees of the coal forests.</p>

<p>In the coal-measures of Granton, near Edinburgh, a remarkable
fossil (Fig. 473) was found and described in 1840,* by Dr. Robert
Paterson. It was compressed between layers of bituminous shale, and
consists of a stem bearing a cylindrical spike, <i>a,</i> which in
the portion preserved in the slate exhibits two subdivisions and
part of a third. The spike is covered on the exposed surface with
the four-cleft calyces of the flowers arranged in parallel rows.
The stem shows, at <i>b,</i> a little below the spike, remains of a
lateral appendage, which is supposed to indicate the beginning of
the spathe. The fossil has been referred to the <i>
Aroidi&aelig;,</i> and</p>

<img src="images3/fig473.jpg" width="260" height="357" alt=
"Fig. 473: Pothocites Grantonii." align="left"> 

<p>there is every probability that it is a true member of this
order. There can at least be no doubt as to the high grade of its
organisation, and that it belongs to the monocotyledonous
angiosperms. Mr. Carruthers has carefully examined the original
specimen in the Botanical Museum, Edinburgh, and thinks it may have
been an epiphyte.</p>

<p><b>Climate of the Coal Period.</b>&mdash;As to the climate of
the Coal, the Ferns and the Conifer&aelig; are perhaps the two
classes of plants which may be most relied upon as leading us to
safe conclusions, as the genera are nearly allied to living types.
All botanists admit that the abundance of ferns implies a moist
atmosphere. But the conifer&aelig;, says Hooker, are of more
doubtful import, as they are found in hot and dry, and in cold and
dry climates; in hot and moist, and in cold and moist regions. In
New Zealand the conifer&aelig; attain their maximum in numbers,
constituting 1/62 part of all the flowering plants; whereas in a
wide district around the Cape of Good Hope they do not form 1/1600
of the phenogamic flora. Besides the conifers, many species of
ferns flourish in New Zealand, some of them arborescent, together
with many lycopodiums; so that a forest in that country may make a
nearer approach to the carboniferous vegetation than any other now
existing on the globe.</p>

<br>
<center><small>MARINE &nbsp;FAUNA &nbsp;OF &nbsp;THE&nbsp;
CARBONIFEROUS&nbsp; PERIOD.</small></center>

<p>It has already been stated that the Carboniferous or Mountain
Limestone underlies the coal-measures in the South of England and
Wales, whereas in the North, and in Scotland, marine calcareous
rocks partly of the age of the Mountain Limestone alternate with
shales and sandstones, containing seams of coal. In its most
calcareous form the Mountain Limestone is destitute of land-plants,
and is loaded</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 431">[ 431 ]</a></p>

<p>with marine remains&mdash;the greater part, indeed, of the rock being
made up bodily of crinoids, corals, and bryozoa with interspersed
mollusca.</p>

<p><b>Corals.</b>&mdash;The corals deserve especial notice, as the
cup-and-star corals, which have the most massive and stony
skeletons, display peculiarities of structure by which they may be
distinguished generally, as MM. Milne Edwards and Haime first
pointed out, from all species found in strata newer than the
Permian. There is, in short, an ancient or <i>Pal&aelig;ozoic,</i>
and a modern or <i>Neozoic</i> type, if, by the latter term, we
designate (as proposed by Professor E. Forbes) all strata from the
triassic to the most modern, inclusive. The accompanying diagrams
(Figs. 474, 475) may illustrate these types.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the more ancient corals have what is called
a quadripartite arrangement of the chief plates or <i>
lamell&aelig;</i>&mdash;parts of the skeleton which support the organs
of reproduction. The number of these lamell&aelig; in the
Pal&aelig;ozoic type is 4, 8, 16, etc.; while in the Neozoic type
the number is 6, 12, 24, or some other multiple of six; and this
holds good, whether they be simple forms, as in Figs. 474, <i>
a,</i> and 475, <i>a,</i> or aggregate clusters of corallites, as
in 474, <i>c.</i> But further investigations have shown in this, as
in all similar grand generalisations in natural history, that there
are excepions to the rule. Thus in the Lower Greensand <i>
Holocystis elegans</i> (Ed. and H.) and other forms have the
Pal&aelig;ozoic type, and Dr. Duncan has shown to what extent the
Neozoic forms penetrate downward into the Carboniferous and
Devonian rocks.</p>

<p>From a great number of lamelliferous corals met with in the
Mountain Limestone, two species (Figs. 476, 477) have been
selected, as having a very wide range, extending from the eastern
borders of Russia to the British Isles, and being found almost
everywhere in each country. These fossils, together with numerous
species of <i>Zaphrentis, Amplexus, Cyathophyllum, Clisiophyllum,
Syringopora,</i> and <i>Michelinia,</i>* form a group of rugose
corals widely different from any that followed them.</p>

<p><b>Bryozoa and Crinoidea.</b>&mdash;Of the <i>Bryozoa,</i> the
prevailing forms are <i>Fenestella, Hemitrypa,</i> and <i>
Polypora,</i> and these often form considerable beds. Their
net-like fronds are easily recognised. <i>Crinoidea</i> are also
numerous in the Mountain Limestone (see Figs. 478, 479), two
genera, <i>Pentremites</i> and <i>Codonaster,</i> being peculiar to
this formation in Europe and North America.</p>

<p>In the greater part of them, the cup or pelvis, Figure 479, <i>
b,</i> is greatly developed in size in proportion to the arms,
although this is not the case in Fig. 478. The genera <i>
Poteriocrinus, Cyathocrinus, Pentremites, Actinocrinus,</i> and <i>
Platycrinus,</i> are all of them characteristic of this formation.
Other Echinoderms are rare, a few Sea-Urchins only being known:
these have a complex structure, with many more plates on their
surface than are seen in the modern genera of the same group. One
genus, the <i>Pal&aelig;chinus</i> (Fig. 480), is the analogue of
the modern <i>Echinus,</i> but has four, five, or six rows of
plates in the interambulacral region or area, whereas the modern
genera have only two. The other, <i>Arch&aelig;ocidaris,</i>
represents, in like manner, the <i>Cidaris</i> of the present
seas.</p>

genera, occurring chiefly in the Mountain Limestone. Of</p>

<p>this large number only 40 species are common to the underlying
Devonian rocks, 9 of them being Cephalopods, 7 Gasteropods, and the
rest bivalves, chiefly Brachiopoda (or Palliobranchiates). This
latter group constitutes the larger part of the Carboniferous
Mollusca, 157 species being known in Great Britain alone, and it
will be found to increase in importance in the fauna of the primary
rocks the lower we descend in the series. Perhaps the most
characteristic shells of the formation are large species of <i>
Productus,</i> such as <i>P. giganteus, p. hemisphericus, P.
semireticulatus</i> (Fig. 481), and <i>P. scabriculus.</i> Large
plaited spirifers, as <i>Spirifera striata, S. rotundata,</i> and
<i>S. trigonalis</i> (Fig. 482), also abound; and smooth species,
such as <i>Spirifera glabra</i> (Fig. 483), with its numerous
varieties.</p>

deserves mention, not only for its wide range, but because it often

<p>stripes which ornamented the living shell. These coloured bands
are also preserved in several lamellibranchiate bivalves, as in <i>
Aviculopecten</i> (Fig. 485), in which dark stripes alternate with
a light ground. In some also of the spiral univalves the pattern of
the original painting is distinctly retained, as in <i>
Pleurotomaria</i> (Fig. 486), which displays wavy blotches,
resembling the colouring in many recent trochid&aelig;.</p>

<center><img src="images3/fig487.jpg" width="393" height="340" alt=
"Fig. 487: Euomphalus pentagulatus."></center>

<p>Some few of the carboniferous mollusca, such as Avicula, <i>
Nucula</i> (sub-genus <i>Ctenodonta</i>), <i>Solemya,</i> and <i>
Lithodomus,</i> belong no doubt to existing genera; but the
majority, though often referred to as living types, such as <i>
Isocardia, Turritella,</i> and <i>Buccinum,</i> belong really to
forms which appear to have become extinct at the close of the
Pal&aelig;ozoic epoch. <i>Euomphalus</i> is a characteristic
univalve shell of this period. In the interior it is divided into
chambers (Fig. 487, <i>d</i>), the septa or partitions not being
perforated as in foraminiferous shells, or in those having
siphuncles, like the Nautilus. The animal appears to have retreated
at different periods of its growth from the internal cavity
previously formed, and to have closed all communication with it by
a septum. The number of chambers is irregular, and they are
generally wanting in the innermost whorl. The animal of the recent
<i>Turritella communis</i> partitions off in like manner as it
advances in age a part of its spire, forming a shelly septum.</p>

"Fig. 488: Bellerophon costatus." align="left"> 

<p>More than twenty species of the genus <i>Bellerophon</i> (see
Fig. 488), a shell like the living Argonaut without chambers, occur
in the Mountain Limestone. The genus is not met with in strata of
later date. It is most generally regarded as belonging to the
pelagic Nucleobranchiata and the family Atlantid&aelig;, partly
allied to the Glass-Shell, <i>Carinaria</i>; but by some few it is
thought to be a simple form of Cephalopod.</p>

"Fig. 489: Portion of Orthoxeras laterale. Fig. 490: Goniatites crenistra."
 align="right"> 

<p>The carboniferous Cephalopoda do not depart so widely from the
living type (the Nautilus) as do the more ancient Silurian
representatives of the same order; yet they offer some remarkable
forms. Among these is <i>Orthoceras,</i> a siphuncled and chambered
shell, like a Nautilus uncoiled and straightened (Fig. 489). Some
species of this genus are several feet long. The <i>Goniatite</i>
is another genus, nearly allied to the <i>Ammonite,</i> from which
it differs in having the lobes of the septa free from lateral
denticulations, or crenatures; so that the outline of these is
angular, continuous, and uninterrupted. The species represented in
Fig. 490 is found in most localities, and presents the zigzag
character of the septal lobes in perfection. The dorsal position of
the siphuncle, however, clearly distinguishes the Goniatite from
the Nautilus, and proves it to have belonged to the family of the
Ammonites, from which, indeed, some authors do not believe it to be
generically distinct.</p>

<p><b>Fossil Fish.</b>&mdash;The distribution of these is
singularly partial; so much so, that M. De Koninck of Li&eacute;ge,
the eminent pal&aelig;ontologist, once stated to me that, in making
his extensive collection of the fossils of the Mountain Limestone
of Belgium, he had found no more than four or five examples of the
bones or teeth of fishes. Judging from Belgian data, he might have
concluded that this class of vertebrata was of extreme rarity in
the Carboniferous seas; whereas the</p>

<p>investigation of other countries has led to quite a different
result. Thus, near Clifton, on the Avon, as well as at numerous
places around the Bristol basin from the Mendip Hills to Tortworth,
there is a celebrated &ldquo;bone-bed,&rdquo; almost entirely made
up of ichthyolites. It occurs at the base of the Lower Limestone
shales immediately resting upon the passage beds of the Old Red
Sandstone. Similar bone-beds occur in the Carboniferous Limestone
of Armagh, in Ireland, where they are made up chiefly of the teeth
of fishes of the Placoid order, nearly all of them rolled as if
drifted from a distance. Some teeth are sharp and pointed, as in
ordinary sharks, of which the genus <i>Cladodus</i> afford an
illustration; but the majority, as in <i>Psammodus</i> and <i>
Cochliodus,</i> are, like the teeth of the Cestracion of Port
Jackson (see <a href="images2/fig261.jpg">Fig. 261</a>), massive
palatal teeth fitted for grinding. (See Figs. 491, 492.)</p>

<img src="images3/fig492.jpg" width="200" height="186" alt=
"Fig. 492: Cochliodus controtus." align="right"> 

<p>There are upward of seventy other species of fossil fish known
in the Mountain Limestone of the British Islands. The defensive
fin-bones of these creatures are not infrequent at Armagh and
Bristol; those known as <i>Oracanthus, Ctenocanthus,</i> and <i>
Onchus</i> are often of a very large size. Ganoid fish, such as <i>
Holoptychius,</i> also occur; but these are far less numerous. The
great <i>Megalichthys Hibberti</i> appears to range from the Upper
Coal-measures to the lowest Carboniferous strata.</p>

<p><b>Foraminifera.</b>&mdash;In the upper part of the Mountain
Limestone group in the S.W. of England, near Bristol, limestones
having a distinct oolitic structure alternate with shales. In these
rocks the nucleus of every minute spherule is seen, under the
microscope, to consist of a small rhizopod or foraminifer. This
division of the lower animals, which is represented so fully at
later epochs by the Nummulites and their numerous minute allies,
appears in the Mountain Limestone to be restricted to a very few
species, among which <i>Textularia, Nodosaria, Endothyra,</i> and
<i>Fusulina</i> (Fig. 493), have been</p>

after periods; the third has been found in the Upper Silurian, but
is not known above the Carboniferous strata; the fourth (Fig. 493)
is characteristic of the Mountain Limestone in the United States,
Arctic America, Russia, and Asia Minor, but is also known in the
Permian.</p>
