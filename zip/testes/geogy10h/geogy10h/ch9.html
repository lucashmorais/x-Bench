<p>By reference to the tables given at the end of the last chapter
the reader will see that when the fossiliferous rocks are arranged
chronologically, we have first to consider the Post-tertiary and
then the Tertiary or Cainozoic formations, and afterwards to pass
on to those of older date.</p>

"Fig. 86: Order of Superposition of Deposits"></center>

<p><b>Order of
Superposition.</b>&mdash;The diagram (Fig. 86) will show the
order of superposition of these deposits, assuming them all to be
visible in one continuous section. In nature, as before hinted
<a href="ch6.html#page 107">(p. 107)</a>, we have never an opportunity of seeing the
whole of them so displayed in a single region; first, because
sedimentary deposition is confined, during any one geological
period, to limited areas; and secondly, because strata, after they
have been formed, are liable to be utterly annihilated over wide
areas by denudation. But wherever certain members of the series are
present, they overlie one another in the order indicated in the
diagram, though not always in the exact manner there represented,
because some of them repose occasionally in unconformable
stratification on others. This mode of superposition has been
already explained <a href="ch5.html#page 94">(p. 94,</a> <a href="ch7.html#page 111">p. 111</a>), where I pointed out that the discordance which implies a considerable lapse
of time between two</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 138">[ 138 ]</a></p>

<p>formations in juxtaposition is almost invariably accompanied by
a great dissimilarity in the species of organic remains.</p>

<p><b>Frequent Unconformability of
Strata.</b>&mdash;Where the widest gaps appear in the
sequence of the fossil forms, as between the Permian and Triassic
rocks, or between the Cretaceous and Eocene, examples of such
unconformability are very frequent. But they are also met with in
some part or other of the world at the junction of almost all the
other principal formations, and sometimes the subordinate divisions
of any one of the leading groups may be found lying unconformably
on another subordinate member of the same&mdash;the Upper, for
example, on the Lower Silurian, or the superior division of the Old
Red Sandstone on a lower member of the same, and so forth.
Instances of such irregularities in the mode of succession of the
strata are the more intelligible the more we extend our survey of
the fossiliferous formations, for we are continually bringing to
light deposits of intermediate date, which have to be intercalated
between those previously known, and which reveal to us a long
series of events, of which antecedently to such discoveries we had
no knowledge.</p>

<p>But while unconformability invariably bears testimony to a lapse
of unrepresented time, the conformability of two sets of strata in
contact by no means implies that the newer formation immediately
succeeded the older one. It simply implies that the ancient rocks
were subjected to no movements of such a nature as to tilt, bend,
or break them before the more modern formation was superimposed. It
does not show that the earth&rsquo;s crust was motionless in the region
in question, for there may have been a gradual sinking or rising,
extending uniformly over a large surface, and yet, during such
movement, the stratified rocks may have retained their original
horizontality of position. There may have been a conversion of a
wide area from sea into land and from land into sea, and during
these changes of level some strata may have been slowly removed by
aqueous action, and after this new strata may be superimposed,
differing perhaps in date by thousands of years or centuries, and
yet resting conformably on the older set. There may even be a
blending of the materials constituting the older deposit with those
of the newer, so as to give rise to a passage in the mineral
character of the one rock into the other as if there had been no
break or interruption in the depositing process.</p>

<p><b>Imperfection of the
Record.</b>&mdash;Although by the frequent discovery of new
sets of intermediate strata the transition from one type of organic
remains to another is becoming less and</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 139">[ 139 ]</a></p>

<p>less abrupt, yet the entire series of records appears to the
geologists now living far more fragmentary and defective than it
seemed to their predecessors half a century ago. The earlier
inquirers, as often as they encountered a break in the regular
sequence of formations, connected it theoretically with a sudden
and violent catastrophe, which had put an end to the regular course
of events that had been going on uninterruptedly for ages,
annihilating at the same time all or nearly all the organic beings
which had previously flourished, after which, order being
re-established, a new series of events was initiated. In proportion
as our faith in these views grows weaker, and the phenomena of the
organic or inorganic world presented to us by geology seem
explicable on the hypothesis of gradual and insensible changes,
varied only by occasional convulsions, on a scale comparable to
that witnessed in historical times; and in proportion as it is
thought possible that former fluctuations in the organic world may
be due to the indefinite modifiability of species without the
necessity of assuming new and independent acts of creation, the
number and magnitude of the gaps which still remain, or the extreme
imperfection of the record, become more and more striking, and what
we possess of the ancient annals of the earth&rsquo;s history appears as
nothing when contrasted with that which has been lost.</p>

<p>When we examine a large area such as Europe, the average as well
as the extreme height above the sea attained by the older
formations is usually found to exceed that reached by the more
modern ones, the primary or palaeozoic rising higher than the
secondary, and these in their turn than the tertiary; while in
reference to the three divisions of the tertiary, the lowest or
Eocene group attains a higher summit-level than the Miocene, and
these again a greater height than the Pliocene formations. Lastly,
the post-tertiary deposits, such, at least, as are of marine
origin, are most commonly restricted to much more moderate
elevations above the sea-level than the tertiary strata.</p>

<p>It is also observed that strata, in proportion as they are of
newer date, bear the nearest resemblance in mineral character to
those which are now in the progress of formation in seas or lakes,
the newest of all consisting principally of soft mud or loose sand,
in some places full of shells, corals, or other organic bodies,
animal or vegetable, in others wholly devoid of such remains. The
farther we recede from the present time, and the higher the
antiquity of the formations which we examine, the greater are the
changes which the sedimentary deposits have undergone. Time, as I
have</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 140">[ 140 ]</a></p>

<p>explained in Chapters V, VI, and VII, has multiplied the effects
of condensation by pressure and cementation, and the modification
produced by heat, fracture, contortion, upheaval, and denudation.
The organic remains also have sometimes been obliterated entirely,
or the mineral matter of which they were composed has been removed
and replaced by other substances.</p>

<p><b>Why newer Groups should be studied
first.</b>&mdash;We likewise observe that the older the
rocks the more widely do their organic remains depart from the
types of the living creation. First, we find in the newer tertiary
rocks a few species which no longer exist, mixed with many living
ones, and then, as we go farther back, many genera and families at
present unknown make their appearance, until we come to strata in
which the fossil relics of existing species are nowhere to be
detected, except a few of the lowest forms of invertebrate, while
some orders of animals and plants wholly unrepresented in the
living world begin to be conspicuous.</p>

<p>When we study, therefore, the geological records of the earth
and its inhabitants, we find, as in human history, the
defectiveness and obscurity of the monuments always increasing the
remoter the era to which we refer, and the difficulty of
determining the true chronological relations of rocks is more and
more enhanced, especially when we are comparing those which were
formed simultaneously in very distant regions of the globe. Hence
we advance with securer steps when we begin with the study of the
geological records of later times, proceeding from the newer to the
older, or from the more to the less known.</p>

<p>In thus inverting what might at first seem to be the more
natural order of historical research, we must bear in mind that
each of the periods above enumerated, even the shortest, such as
the Post-tertiary, or the Pliocene, Miocene, or Eocene, embrace a
succession of events of vast extent, so that to give a satisfactory
account of what we already know of any one of them would require
many volumes. When, therefore, we approach one of the newer groups
before endeavouring to decipher the monuments of an older one, it
is like endeavouring to master the history of our own country and
that of some contemporary nations, before we enter upon Roman
History, or like investigating the annals of Ancient Italy and
Greece before we approach those of Egypt and Assyria.</p>

<p><b>Nomenclature.</b>&mdash;The origin
of the terms Primary and Secondary, and the synonymous terms
Palaeozoic, and Mesozoic, were explained in Chapter VIII, p.
123.</p>

<p>The Tertiary or Cainozoic strata (see <a href="ch8.html#page 123">p. 123</a>) were
so called</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 141">[ 141 ]</a></p>

<p>because they were all posterior in date to the Secondary series,
of which last the Chalk of Cretaceous, No. 9, Fig. 86, constitutes
the newest group. The whole of them were at first confounded with
the superficial alluviums of Europe; and it was long before their
real extent and thickness, and the various ages to which they
belong, were fully recognised. They were observed to occur in
patches, some of fresh-water, others of marine origin, their
geographical area being usually small as compared to the secondary
formations, and their position often suggesting the idea of their
having been deposited in different bays, lakes, estuaries, or
inland seas, after a large portion of the space now occupied by
Europe had already been converted into dry land.</p>

<p>The first deposits of this class, of which the characters were
accurately determined, were those occurring in the neighbourhood of
Paris, described in 1810 by MM. Cuvier and Brongniart. They were
ascertained to consist of successive sets of strata, some of
marine, others of fresh-water origin, lying one upon the other. The
fossil shells and corals were perceived to be almost all of unknown
species, and to have in general a near affinity to those now
inhabiting warmer seas. The bones and skeletons of land animals,
some of them of large size, and belonging to more than forty
distinct species, were examined by Cuvier, and declared by him not
to agree specifically, nor most of them even generically, with any
hitherto observed in the living creation.</p>

<p>Strata were soon afterwards brought to light in the vicinity of
London, and in Hampshire, which, although dissimilar in mineral
composition, were justly inferred by Mr. T. Webster to be of the
same age as those of Paris, because the greater number of the
fossil shells were specifically identical. For the same reason,
rocks found on the Gironde, in the South of France, and at certain
points in the North of Italy, were suspected to be of
contemporaneous origin.</p>

<p>Another important discovery was soon afterwards made by Brocchi
in Italy, who investigated the argillaceous and sandy deposits,
replete with shells, which form a low range of hills, flanking the
Apennines on both sides, from the plains of the Po to Calabria.
These lower hills were called by him the Subapennines, and were
formed of strata chiefly marine, and newer than those of Paris and
London.</p>

<p>Another tertiary group occurring in the neighbourhood of
Bordeaux and Dax, in the South of France, was examined by M. de
Basterot in 1825, who described and figured several hundred species
of shells, which differed for the most part both from the Parisian
series and those of the Subapennine hills.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 142">[ 142 ]</a></p>

<p>It was soon, therefore, suspected that this fauna might belong
to a period intermediate between that of the Parisian and
Subapennine strata, and it was not long before the evidence of
superposition was brought to bear in support of this opinion; for
other strata, contemporaneous with those of Bordeaux, were observed
in one district (the Valley of the Loire), to overlie the Parisian
formation, and in another (in Piedmont) to underlie the Subapennine
beds. The first example of these was pointed out in 1829 by M.
Desnoyers, who ascertained that the sand and marl of marine origin
called faluns, near Tours, in the basin of the Loire, full of
sea-shells and corals, rested upon a lacustrine formation, which
constitutes the uppermost subdivision of the Parisian group,
extending continuously throughout a great table-land intervening
between the basin of the Seine and that of the Loire. The other
example occurs in Italy, where strata containing many fossils
similar to those of Bordeaux were observed by Bonelli and others in
the environs of Turin, subjacent to strata belonging to the
Subapennine group of Brocchi.</p>

<p><b>Value of Testacean Fossils in
Classification.</b>&mdash;It will be observed that in the
foregoing allusions to organic remains, the testacea or the
shell-bearing mollusca are selected as the most useful and
convenient class for the purposes of general classification. In the
first place, they are more universally distributed through strata
of every age than any other organic bodies. Those families of
fossils which are of rare and casual occurrence are absolutely of
no avail in establishing a chronological arrangement. If we have
plants alone in one group of strata and the bones of mammalia in
another, we can draw no conclusion respecting the affinity or
discordance of the organic beings of the two epochs compared; and
the same may be said if we have plants and vertebrated animals in
one series and only shells in another. Although corals are more
abundant, in a fossil state, than plants, reptiles, or fish, they
are still rare when contrasted with shells, because they are more
dependent for their well-being on the constant clearness of the
water, and are, therefore, less likely to be included in rocks
which endure in consequence of their thickness and the copiousness
of sediment which prevailed when they originated. The utility of
the testacea is, moreover, enhanced by the circumstance that some
forms are proper to the sea, others to the land, and others to
fresh water. Rivers scarcely ever fail to carry down into their
deltas some land-shells, together with species which are at once
fluviatile and lacustrine. By this means we learn what terrestrial,
fresh-water, and marine</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 143">[ 143 ]</a></p>

<p>species coexisted at particular eras of the past: and having
thus identified strata formed in seas with others which originated
contemporaneously in inland lakes, we are then enabled to advance a
step farther, and show that certain quadrupeds or aquatic plants,
found fossil in lacustrine formations, inhabited the globe at the
same period when certain fish, reptiles, and zoophytes lived in the
ocean.</p>

<p>Among other characters of the molluscous animals, which render
them extremely valuable in settling chronological questions in
geology, may be mentioned, first, the wide geographical range of
many species; and, secondly, what is probably a consequence of the
former, the great duration of species in this class, for they
appear to have surpassed in longevity the greater number of the
mammalia and fish. Had each species inhabited a very limited space,
it could never, when imbedded in strata, have enabled the geologist
to identify deposits at distant points; or had they each lasted but
for a brief period, they could have thrown no light on the
connection of rocks placed far from each other in the
chronological, or, as it is often termed, vertical series.</p>

<p><b>Classification of Tertiary
Strata.</b>&mdash;Many authors have divided the European
Tertiary strata into three groups&mdash;lower, middle, and upper;
the lower comprising the oldest formations of Paris and London
before mentioned; the middle those of Bordeaux and Touraine; and
the upper all those newer than the middle group.</p>

<p>In the first edition of the Principles of Geology, I divided the
whole of the Tertiary formations into four groups, characterised by
the percentage of recent shells which they contained. The lower
tertiary strata of London and Paris were thought by M. Deshayes to
contain only 3&frac12; per cent of recent species, and were termed
Eocene. The middle tertiary of the Loire and Gironde had, according
to the specific determinations of the same conchologist, 17 per
cent, and formed the Miocene division. The Subapennine beds
contained 35 to 50 per cent, and were termed Older Pliocene, while
still more recent beds in Sicily, which had from 90 to 95 per cent
of species identical with those now living, were called Newer
Pliocene. The first of the above terms, Eocene, is derived from
eos, <i>dawn</i>, and cainos, <i>recent</i>, because the fossil
shells of this period contain an extremely small proportion of
living species, which may be looked upon as indicating the dawn of
the existing state of the testaceous fauna, no recent species
having been detected in the older or secondary rocks.</p>

<p>The term Miocene (from meion, <i>less</i>, and cainos,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 144">[ 144 ]</a></p>

<p><i>recent</i>) is intended to express a minor proportion of
recent species (of testacea), the term Pliocene (from pleion, <i>
more</i>, and cainos, <i>recent</i>) a comparative plurality of the
same. It may assist the memory of students to remind them, that the
<i>Mi</i>ocene contain a <i>mi</i>nor proportion, and <i>
Pl</i>iocene a comparative <i>pl</i>urality of recent species; and
that the greater number of recent species always implies the more
modern origin of the strata.</p>

<p>It has sometimes been objected to this nomenclature that certain
species of infusoria found in the chalk are still existing, and, on
the other hand, the Miocene and Older Pliocene deposits often
contain the remains of mammalia, reptiles, and fish, exclusively of
extinct species. But the reader must bear in mind that the terms
Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene were originally invented with
reference purely to conchological data, and in that sense have
always been and are still used by me.</p>

<p>Since the year 1830 the number of known shells, both recent and
fossil, has largely increased, and their identification has been
more accurately determined. Hence some modifications have been
required in the classifications founded on less perfect materials.
The Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene periods have been made to
comprehend certain sets of strata of which the fossils do not
always conform strictly in the proportion of recent to extinct
species with the definitions first given by me, or which are
implied in the etymology of those terms.</p>
