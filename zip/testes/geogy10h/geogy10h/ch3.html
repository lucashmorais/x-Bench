<p>Having in the last chapter considered the forms of
stratification so far as they are determined by the arrangement of
inorganic matter, we may now turn our attention to the manner in
which organic remains are distributed through stratified deposits.
We should often be unable to detect any signs of stratification or
of successive deposition, if particular kinds of fossils did not
occur here and there at certain depths in the mass. At one level,
for example, univalve shells of some one or more species
predominate; at another, bivalve shells; and at a third, corals;
while in some formations we find layers of vegetable matter,
commonly derived from land plants, separating strata.</p>

<p>It may appear inconceivable to a beginner how mountains, several
thousand feet thick, can have become full of fossils from top to
bottom; but the difficulty is removed, when he reflects on the
origin of stratification, as explained in the last chapter, and
allows sufficient time for the accumulation of sediment. He must
never lose sight of the fact that, during the process of
deposition, each separate layer was once the uppermost, and
immediately in contact with the water in which aquatic animals
lived. Each stratum, in fact, however far it may now lie beneath
the surface, was once in the state of shingle, or loose sand or
soft mud at the bottom of the sea, in which shells and other bodies
easily became enveloped.</p>

<p><b>Rate of Deposition indicated by
Fossils.</b>&mdash;By attending to the nature of these
remains, we are often enabled to determine whether the deposition
was slow or rapid, whether it took place in a deep or shallow sea,
near the shore or far</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 48">[ 48 ]</a></p>

<p>from land, and whether the water was salt, brackish, or fresh.
Some limestones consist almost exclusively of corals, and in many
cases it is evident that the present position of each fossil
zoophyte has been determined by the manner in which it grew
originally. The axis of the coral, for example, if its natural
growth is erect, still remains at right angles to the plane of
stratification. If the stratum be now horizontal, the round
spherical heads of certain species continue uppermost, and their
points of attachment are directed downward. This arrangement is
sometimes repeated throughout a great succession of strata. From
what we know of the growth of similar zoophytes in modern reefs, we
infer that the rate of increase was extremely slow, and some of the
fossils must have flourished for ages like forest-trees, before
they attained so large a size. During these ages, the water must
have been clear and transparent, for such corals can not live in
turbid water.</p>

"Fossil Gryph&aelig;, covered both on the outside and inside with fossil serpul&aelig;." align="left"> 

<p>In like manner, when we see thousands of full-grown shells
dispersed everywhere throughout a long series of strata, we can not
doubt that time was required for the multiplication of successive
generations; and the evidence of slow accumulation is rendered more
striking from the proofs, so often discovered, of fossil bodies
having lain for a time on the floor of the ocean after death before
they were imbedded in sediment. Nothing, for example, is more
common than to see fossil oysters in clay, with Serpul&aelig;, or
barnacles (acorn-shells), or corals, and other creatures, attached
to the inside of the valves, so that the mollusk was certainly not
buried in argillaceous mud the moment it died. There must have been
an interval during which it was still surrounded with clear water,
when the creatures whose remains now adhere to it grew from an
embryonic to a mature state. Attached shells which are merely
external, like some of the Serpul&aelig; (<i>a</i>) in Fig. 9, may
often have grown upon an</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 49">[ 49 ]</a></p>

<p>oyster or other shell while the animal within was still living;
but if they are found on the inside, it could only happen after the
death of the inhabitant of the shell which affords the support.
Thus, in Fig. 9, it will be seen that two Serpul&aelig; have grown
on the interior, one of them exactly on the place where the
adductor muscle of the <i>Gryph&aelig;a</i> (a kind of oyster) was
fixed.</p>

"Fig. 10: Serpula attached to a fossil. Fig. 11: Recent Spatangus with spines removed from one side."
 align="left"> 

<p>Some fossil shells, even if simply attached to the <i>
outside</i> of others, bear full testimony to the conclusion above
alluded to, namely, that an interval elapsed between the death of
the creature to whose shell they adhere, and the burial of the same
in mud or sand. The sea-urchins, or <i>Echini</i>, so abundant in
white chalk, afford a good illustration. It is well known that
these animals, when living, are invariably covered with spines
supported by rows of tubercles. These last are only seen after the
death of the sea-urchin, when the spines have dropped off. In Fig.
11 a living species of <i>Spatangus</i>, common on our coast, is
represented with one half of its shell stripped of the spines. In
Fig. 10 a fossil of a similar and allied genus from the white chalk
of England shows the naked surface which the individuals of this
family exhibit when denuded of their bristles. The full-grown <i>
Serpula</i>, therefore, which now adheres externally, could not
have begun to grow till the <i>Micraster</i> had died, and the
spines became detached.</p>

"Fig. 12: Ananchytes from the chalk." align=
"right"> 

<p>Now the series of events here attested by a single fossil may be
carried a step farther. Thus, for example, we often meet with a
sea-urchin (<i>Ananchytes</i>) in the chalk (see Fig. 12) which has
fixed to it the lower valve of a <i>Crania</i>, a genus of bivalve
mollusca. The upper valve (<i>b</i>, Fig. 12) is almost invariably
wanting, though occasionally found in a perfect state of
preservation in white chalk at some distance. In this case, we see
clearly that the sea-urchin first</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 50">[ 50 ]</a></p>

<p>lived from youth to age, then died and lost its spines, which
were carried away. Then the young <i>Crania</i> adhered to the
bared shell, grew and perished in its turn; after which the upper
valve was separated from the lower before the <i>Ananchytes</i>
became enveloped in chalky mud.</p>

<center><img src="images/fig14.jpg" width="351" height="184" alt=
"Fig. 14: Recent wood bored by Teredo."></center>

<p>It may be well to mention one more illustration of the manner in
which single fossils may sometimes throw light on a former state of
things, both in the bed of the ocean and on some adjoining land. We
meet with many fragments of wood bored by ship-worms at various
depths in the clay on which London is built. Entire branches and
stems of trees, several feet in length, are sometimes found drilled
all over by the holes of these borers, the tubes and shells of the
mollusk still remaining in the cylindrical hollows. In Fig. 14, <i>
e</i>, a representation is given of a piece of recent wood pierced
by the <i>Teredo navalis</i>, or common ship-worm, which destroys
wooden piles and ships. When the cylindrical tube <i>d</i> has been
extracted from the wood, the valves are seen at the larger or
anterior extremity, as shown at <i>c.</i> In like manner, a piece
of fossil wood (<i>a</i>, Fig. 13) has been perforated by a kindred
but extinct genus, the <i>Teredina</i> of Lamarck. The calcareous
tube of this mollusk was united and, as it were, soldered on to the
valves of the shell (<i>b</i>), which therefore can not be detached
from the tube, like the valves of</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 51">[ 51 ]</a></p>

<p>the recent <i>Teredo.</i> The wood in this fossil specimen is
now converted into a stony mass, a mixture of clay and lime; but it
must once have been buoyant and floating in the sea, when the <i>
Teredin&aelig;</i> lived upon, and perforated it. Again, before the
infant colony settled upon the drift wood, part of a tree must have
been floated down to the sea by a river, uprooted, perhaps, by a
flood, or torn off and cast into the waves by the wind: and thus
our thoughts are carried back to a prior period, when the tree grew
for years on dry land, enjoying a fit soil and climate.</p>

<p><b>Strata of Organic
Origin.</b>&mdash;It has been already remarked that there
are rocks in the interior of continents, at various depths in the
earth, and at great heights above the sea, almost entirely made up
of the remains of zoophytes and testacea. Such masses may be
compared to modern oyster-beds and coral-reefs; and, like them, the
rate of increase must have been extremely gradual. But there are a
variety of stone deposits in the earth&rsquo;s crust, now proved to have
been derived from plants and animals of which the organic origin
was not suspected until of late years, even by naturalists. Great
surprise was therefore created some years since by the discovery of
Professor Ehrenberg, of Berlin, that a certain kind of siliceous
stone, called tripoli, was entirely composed of millions of the
remains of organic beings, which were formerly referred to
microscopic Infusoria, but which are now admitted to be plants.
They abound in rivulets, lakes, and ponds in England and other
countries, and are termed Diatomace&aelig; by those naturalists who
believe in their vegetable origin. The subject alluded to has long
been well-known in the arts, under the name of infusorial earth or
mountain meal, and is used in the form of powder for polishing
stones and metals. It has been procured, among other places, from
the mud of a lake at Dolgelly, in North Wales, and from Bilin, in
Bohemia, in which latter place a single stratum, extending over a
wide area, is no less than fourteen feet thick. This stone, when
examined with a powerful microscope, is found to consist of the
siliceous plates or frustules of the above-figured
Diatomace&aelig;, united together without any visible cement. It is
difficult to convey an idea of their extreme minuteness; but
Ehrenberg estimates that in the Bilin tripoli there are 41,000
millions of individuals of the <i>Gaillonella distans</i> (see Fig.
16) in every cubic inch (which weighs about 220 grains), or about
187 millions in a single grain. At every stroke, therefore, that we
make with this polishing powder, several millions, perhaps tens of
millions, of perfect fossils are crushed to atoms.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<img src="images/fig15.jpg" width="135" height="267" alt=
"Figs 15 and 16: Gaillonella; Fig. 17: Bacillaria parodoxa"
 align="left"> 

<p>A well-known substance, called bog-iron ore, often met with in
peat-mosses, has often been shown by Ehrenberg to consist of
innumerable articulated threads, of a yellow ochre colour, composed
of silica, argillaceous matter, and peroxide of iron. These threads
are the cases of a minute microscopic body, called <i>Gaillonella
ferruginea</i> (Fig. 15), associated with the siliceous frustules
of other fresh-water alg&aelig;. Layers of this iron ore occurring
in Scotch peat bogs are often called &ldquo;the pan,&rdquo;  and are sometimes
of economical value.</p>

<p>It is clear much time must have been required for the
accumulation of strata to which countless generations of
Diatomace&aelig; have contributed their remains; and these
discoveries lead us naturally to suspect that other deposits, of
which the materials have been supposed to be inorganic, may in
reality be composed chiefly of microscopic organic bodies. That
this is the case with the white chalk, has often been imagined, and
is now proved to be the fact. It has, moreover, been lately
discovered that the chambers into which these Foraminifera are
divided are actually often filled with thousands of well-preserved
organic bodies, which abound in every minute grain of chalk, and
are especially apparent in the white coating of flints, often
accompanied by innumerable needle-shaped spicul&aelig; of sponges
(see Chapter XVII).</p>

<center>&ldquo;The dust we tread upon was once
alive!&rdquo;&mdash;B<small>YRON.</small></center>

<p>How faint an idea does this exclamation of the poet convey of
the real wonders of nature! for here we discover proofs that the
calcareous and siliceous dust of which hills are composed has not
only been once alive, but almost every particle, albeit invisible
to the naked eye, still retains the organic structure which, at
periods of time incalculably remote, was impressed upon it by the
powers of life.</p>

<p><b>Fresh-water and Marine
Fossils.</b>&mdash;Strata, whether deposited in salt or
fresh water, have the same forms; but the imbedded fossils are very
different in the two cases, because the aquatic animals which
frequent lakes and rivers are distinct from those inhabiting the
sea. In the northern part of the Isle of Wight formations of marl
and limestone, more than</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 53">[ 53 ]</a></p>

<p>50 feet thick occur, in which the shells are of extinct species.
Yet we recognise their fresh-water origin, because they are of the
same genera as those now abounding in ponds, lakes, and rivers,
either in our own country or in warmer latitudes.</p>

<p>In many parts of France&mdash;in Auvergne, for
example&mdash;strata occur of limestone, marl, and sandstone
hundreds of feet thick, which contain exclusively fresh-water and
land shells, together with the remains of terrestrial quadrupeds.
The number of land-shells scattered through some of these
fresh-water deposits is exceedingly great; and there are districts
in Germany where the rocks scarcely contain any other fossils
except snail-shells (<i>helices</i>); as, for instance, the
limestone on the left bank of the Rhine, between Mayence and Worms,
at Oppenheim, Findheim, Budenheim, and other places. In order to
account for this phenomenon, the geologist has only to examine the
small deltas of torrents which enter the Swiss lakes when the
waters are low, such as the newly-formed plain where the Kander
enters the Lake of Thun. He there sees sand and mud strewn over
with innumerable dead land-shells, which have been brought down
from the valleys in the Alps in the preceding spring, during the
melting of the snows. Again, if we search the sands on the borders
of the Rhine, in the lower part of its course, we find countless
land-shells mixed with others of species belonging to lakes,
stagnant pools, and marshes. These individuals have been washed
away from the alluvial plains of the great river and its
tributaries, some from mountainous regions, others from the low
country.</p>

<p>Although fresh-water formations are often of great thickness,
yet they are usually very limited in area when compared to marine
deposits, just as lakes and estuaries are of small dimensions in
comparison with seas.</p>

<p>The absence of many fossil forms usually met with in marine
strata, affords a useful negative indication of the fresh-water
origin of a formation. For example, there are no sea-urchins, no
corals, no chambered shells, such as the nautilus, nor microscopic
Foraminifera in lacustrine or fluviatile deposits. In
distinguishing the latter from formations accumulated in the sea,
we are chiefly guided by the forms of the mollusca. In a
fresh-water deposit, the number of individual shells is often as
great as in a marine stratum, if not greater; but there is a
smaller variety of species and genera. This might be anticipated
from the fact that the genera and species of recent fresh-water and
land shells are few when contrasted with the marine. Thus, the
genera of true mollusca according to Woodward&rsquo;s system, excluding
those</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 54">[ 54 ]</a></p>

<center><img src="images/fig18.jpg" width="345" height="126" alt=
"Fig. 18: Cyrena obovata. Fig. 19: Cyrena fluminatis."></center>

<p>altogether extinct and those without shells, amount to 446 in
number, of which the terrestrial and fresh-water genera scarcely
form more than a fifth.*</p>

<center><img src="images/fig20.jpg" width="360" height="208" alt=
"Fig. 20: Anodonta Cordierii. Fig. 21: Anodonta latimarginata. Fig. 22: Unio littoralis.">
</center>

<p>Almost all bivalve shells, or those of acephalous mollusca, are
marine, about sixteen only out of 140 genera being fresh-water.
Among these last, the four most common forms, both recent and
fossil, are <i>Cyclas, Cyrena, Unio,</i> and <i>Anodonta</i> (see
Figures); the two first and two last of which are so nearly allied
as to pass into each other.</p>

<img src="images/fig23.jpg" width="142" height="204" alt="Fig. 23: 
Gryph&aelig;a incurva." align="right"> 

<p>Lamarck divided the bivalve mollusca into the Dimyary, or those
having two large muscular impressions in each valve, as <i>a b</i>
in the Cyclas, Fig. 18, and Unio, Fig. 22, and the <i>
Monomyary,</i> such as the oyster and scallop, in which there is
only one of these impressions, as is seen in Fig. 23. Now, as none
of these last, or the unimuscular bivalves, are
fresh-water,&dagger; we may at once presume a deposit containing
any of them to be marine.</p>

<p class="fnote">* See Woodward&rsquo;s Manual of Mollusca, 1856.<br>
&dagger; The fresh-water Mulleria, when young, forms a single
exception to the rule, as it then has two muscular impressions, but
it has only one in the adult state.</p>

<p>The univalve shells most characteristic of fresh-water deposits
are, <i>Planorbis, Limn&aelig;a,</i> and <i>Paludina.</i> (See
Figures.) But to these are occasionally added <i>Physa, Succinea,
Ancylus, Valvata, Melanopsis, Melania, Potamides,</i> and <i>
Neritina</i> (see Figures), the four last being usually found in
estuaries.</p>

<p>Some naturalists include <i>Neritina</i> (Fig. 35) and the
marine <i>Nerita</i> (Fig. 36) in the same genus, it being scarcely
possible to distinguish the two by good generic characters. But, as
a general rule, the</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 56">[ 56 ]</a></p>

<img src="images/fig37.jpg" width="80" height="257" alt="Fig. 37: 
Potamides cinctus." align="left"> 

<p>fluviatile species are smaller, smoother, and more globular than
the marine; and they have never, like the <i>Nerit&aelig;,</i> the
inner margin of the outer lip toothed or crenulated. (See Fig.
36.)</p>

<p>The Potamides inhabit the mouths of rivers in warm latitudes,
and are distinguishable from the marine Cerithia by their orbicular
and multispiral opercula. The genus Auricula (Fig. 31) is
amphibious, frequenting swamps and marshes within the influence of
the tide.</p>

<p>The terrestrial shells are all univalves. The most important
genera among these, both in a recent and fossil state, are <i>
Helix</i> (Fig. 38), <i>Cyclostoma</i> (Fig. 39), <i>Pupa</i> (Fig.
40), <i>Clausilia</i> (Fig. 41), <i>Bulimus</i> (Fig. 42), <i>
Glandina</i> and <i>Achatina.</i></p>

"Fig. 38: Helix Turomensis. Fig. 39: Cyclostoma elegans. Fig. 40: Pupa tridens. Fig. 41: Clausilia bidens. Fig. 42: Bulimus lubricus.">
</center>

<p><i>Ampullaria</i> (Fig. 43) is another genus of shells
inhabiting rivers and ponds in hot countries. Many fossil species
formerly referred to this genus, and which have been met with
chiefly in marine formations, are now considered by conchologists
to belong to <i>Natica</i> and other marine genera.</p>

<img src="images/fig43.jpg" width="111" height="154" alt="Fig. 43: 
Ampullaria glauca." align="left"> 

<p>All univalve shells of land and fresh-water species, with the
exception of <i>Melanopsis</i> (Fig. 34), and <i>Achatina,</i>
which has a slight indentation, have entire mouths; and this
circumstance may often serve as a convenient rule for
distinguishing fresh-water from marine strata; since, if any
univalves occur of which the mouths are not entire, we may presume
that the formation is marine. The aperture is said to be entire in
such shells as the fresh-water <i>Ampullaria</i> and the
land-shells (Figs 38-42), when its outline is not interrupted by an
indentation or notch, such as that seen at <i>b</i> in <i>
Ancillaria</i> (Fig. 45); or is not prolonged into a canal, as that
seen at <i>a</i> in <i>Pleurotoma</i> (Fig. 44).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 57">[ 57 ]</a></p>

<center><img src="images/fig44.jpg" width="319" height="218" alt=
"Fig. 44: Pleurotoma exorta. Fig. 45: Ancillaria subulata."></center>

<p>The mouths of a large proportion of the marine univalves have
these notches or canals, and almost all species are carnivorous;
whereas nearly all testacea having entire mouths are plant-eaters,
whether the species be marine, fresh-water, or terrestrial.</p>

<p>There is, however, one genus which affords an occasional
exception to one of the above rules. The <i>Potamides</i> (Fig.
37), a subgenus of Cerithium, although provided with a short canal,
comprises some species which inhabit salt, others brackish, and
others fresh-water, and they are said to be all plant-eaters.</p>

<p>Among the fossils very common in fresh-water deposits are the
shells of <i>Cypris,</i> a minute bivalve crustaceous animal.* Many
minute living species of this genus swarm in lakes and stagnant
pools in Great Britain; but their shells are not, if considered
separately, conclusive as to the fresh-water origin of a deposit,
because the majority of species in another kindred genus of the
same order, the <i>Cytherina</i> of Lamarck, inhabit salt-water;
and, although the animal differs slightly, the shell is scarcely
distinguishable from that of the Cypris.</p>

<p><b>Fresh-water Fossil
Plants.</b>&mdash;The seed-vessels and stems of <i>
Chara,</i> a genus of aquatic plants, are very frequent in
fresh-water strata. These seed-vessels were called, before their
true nature was known, gyrogonites, and were supposed to be
foraminiferous shells. (See Fig. 46, <i>a</i>.)</p>

<p>The <i>Char&aelig;</i> inhabit the bottom of lakes and ponds,
and flourish mostly where the water is charged with carbonate of
lime. Their seed-vessels are covered with a very tough integument,
capable of resisting decomposition; to which circumstance we may
attribute their abundance in a fossil</p>

<p class="fnote">* For figures of fossil species of Purbeck, see <a

<p>state. The annexed figure (Fig. 47) represents a branch of one
of many new species found by Professor Amici in the lakes of
Northern Italy. The seed-vessel in this plant is more globular than
in the British <i>Char&aelig;,</i>) and therefore more nearly
resembles in form the extinct fossil species found in England,
France, and other countries. The stems, as well as the
seed-vessels, of these plants occur both in modern shell-marl and
in ancient fresh-water formations. They are generally composed of a
large central tube surrounded by smaller ones; the whole stem being
divided at certain intervals by transverse partitions or joints.
(See <i>b,</i> Fig. 46.)</p>

<p>It is not uncommon to meet with layers of vegetable matter,
impressions of leaves, and branches of trees, in strata containing
fresh-water shells; and we also find occasionally the teeth and
bones of land quadrupeds, of species now unknown. The manner in
which such remains are occasionally carried by rivers into lakes,
especially during floods, has been fully treated of in the
&ldquo;Principles of Geology.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Fresh-water and Marine
Fish.</b>&mdash;The remains of fish are occasionally useful
in determining the fresh-water origin of strata. Certain genera,
such as carp, perch, pike, and loach (<i>Cyprinus, Perca, Esox,</i>
and <i>Cobitis</i>), as also <i>Lebias,</i> being peculiar to
fresh-water. Other genera contain some fresh-water and some marine
species, as <i>Cottus, Mugil,</i> and <i>Anguilla,</i> or eel. The
rest are either common to rivers and the sea, as the salmon; or are
exclusively characteristic of salt-water. The above observations
respecting fossil fishes are applicable only to the more modern or
tertiary deposits;</p>

<p>for in the more ancient rocks the forms depart so widely from
those of existing fishes, that it is very difficult, at least in
the present state of science, to derive any positive information
from ichthyolites respecting the element in which strata were
deposited.</p>

<p>The alternation of marine and fresh-water formations, both on a
small and large scale, are facts well ascertained in geology. When
it occurs on a small scale, it may have arisen from the alternate
occupation of certain spaces by river-water and the sea; for in the
flood season the river forces back the ocean and freshens it over a
large area, depositing at the same time its sediment; after which
the salt-water again returns, and, on resuming its former place,
brings with it sand, mud, and marine shells.</p>

<p>There are also lagoons at the mouth of many rivers, as the Nile
and Mississippi, which are divided off by bars of sand from the
sea, and which are filled with salt and fresh water by turns. They
often communicate exclusively with the river for months, years, or
even centuries; and then a breach being made in the bar of sand,
they are for long periods filled with salt-water.</p>

<p><b>Lym-Fiord.</b>&mdash;The Lym-Fiord
in Jutland offers an excellent illustration of analogous changes;
for, in the course of the last thousand years, the western
extremity of this long frith, which is 120 miles in length,
including its windings, has been four times fresh and four times
salt, a bar of sand between it and the ocean having been often
formed and removed. The last irruption of salt water happened in
1824, when the North Sea entered, killing all the fresh-water
shells, fish, and plants; and from that time to the present, the
sea-weed <i>Fucus vesiculosus,</i> together with oysters and other
marine mollusca, have succeeded the <i>Cyclas, Lymn&aelig;a,
Paludina,</i> and <i>Char&aelig;.</i>*</p>

<p>But changes like these in the Lym-Fiord, and those before
mentioned as occurring at the mouths of great rivers, will only
account for some cases of marine deposits of partial extent resting
on fresh-water strata. When we find, as in the south-east of
England (Chapter XVIII), a great series of fresh-water beds, 1000
feet in thickness, resting upon marine formations and again covered
by other rocks, such as the Cretaceous, more than 1000 feet thick,
and of deep-sea origin, we shall find it necessary to seek for a
different explanation of the phenomena.</p>
