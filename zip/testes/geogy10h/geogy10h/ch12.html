<p><b>Glaciation of Scandinavia and Russia.</b>&mdash;In large
tracts of Norway and Sweden, where there have been no glaciers in
historical times, the signs of ice-action have been traced as high
as 6000 feet above the level of the sea. These signs consist
chiefly of polished and furrowed rock-surfaces, of moraines and
erratic blocks. The direction of the erratics, like that of the
furrows, has usually been conformable to the course of the
principal valleys; but the lines of both sometimes radiate outward
in all directions from the highest land, in a manner which is only
explicable by the hypothesis above alluded to of a general envelope
of continental ice, like that of Greenland (<a href="ch11.html#page 170">page 170</a>). Some of
the far-transported blocks have been carried from the central parts
of Scandinavia towards the Polar regions; others southward to
Denmark; some south-westward, to the coast of Norfolk in England;
others south-eastward, to Germany, Poland, and Russia.</p>

<p>In the immediate neighbourhood of Upsala, in Sweden, I had
observed, in 1834, a ridge of stratified sand and gravel, in the
midst of which occurs a layer of marl, evidently formed originally
at the bottom of the Baltic, by the slow growth of the mussel,
cockle, and other marine shells of living species, intermixed with
some proper to fresh water. The marine shells are all of dwarfish
size, like those now inhabiting the brackish waters of the Baltic;
and the marl, in which many of them are imbedded, is now raised
more than 100 feet above the level of the Gulf of Bothnia. Upon the
top of this ridge repose several huge erratics, consisting of
gneiss for the most part unrounded, from nine to sixteen feet in
diameter,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 175">[ 175 ]</a></p>

<p>and which must have been brought into their present position
since the time when the neighbouring gulf was already characterised
by its peculiar fauna. Here, therefore, we have proof that the
transport of erratics continued to take place, not merely when the
sea was inhabited by the existing testacea, but when the north of
Europe had already assumed that remarkable feature of its physical
geography which separates the Baltic from the North Sea, and causes
the Gulf of Bothnia to have only one-fourth of the saltness
belonging to the ocean. In Denmark, also, recent shells have been
found in stratified beds, closely associated with the boulder
clay.</p>

<p><b>Glaciation of Scotland.</b>&mdash;Mr. T. F. Jamieson, in
1858, adduced a great body of facts to prove that the Grampians
once sent down glaciers from the central regions in all directions
towards the sea. &ldquo;The glacial grooves,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;radiate
outward from the central heights towards all points of the compass,
though they do not always strictly conform to the actual shape and
contour of the minor valleys and ridges.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These facts and other characteristics of the Scotch drift lead
us to the inference that when the glacial cold first set in,
Scotland stood higher above the sea than at present, and was
covered for the most part with snow and ice, as Greenland is now.
This sheet of land-ice sliding down to lower levels, ground down
and polished the subjacent rocks, sweeping off nearly all
superficial deposits of older date, and leaving only till and
boulders in their place. To this continental state succeeded a
period of depression and partial submergence. The sea advanced over
the lower lands, and Scotland was converted into an archipelago,
some marine sand with shells being spread over the bottom of the
sea. On this sand a great mass of boulder clay usually quite devoid
of fossils was accumulated. Lastly, the land re-emerged from the
water, and, reaching a level somewhat above its present height,
became connected with the continent of Europe, glaciers being
formed once more in the higher regions, though the ice probably
never regained its former extension.* After all these changes,
there were some minor oscillations in the level of the land, on
which, although they have had important geographical consequences,
separating Ireland from England, for example, and England from the
Continent, we need not here enlarge.</p>

<p><i>Mammoth in Scotch Till.</i>&mdash;Almost all remains of the
terrestrial fauna of the Continent which preceded the period of</p>

<p>submergence have been lost; but a few patches of estuarine and
fresh-water formations escaped denudation by submergence. To these
belong the peaty clay from which several mammoths&rsquo; tusks and horns
of reindeer were obtained at Kilmaurs, in Ayrshire as long ago as
1816. Mr. Bryce in 1865 ascertained that the fresh-water formation
containing these fossils rests on carboniferous sandstone, and is
covered, first by a bed of marine sand with arctic shells, and then
with a great mass of till with glaciated boulders.* Still more
recent explorations in the neighbourhood of Kilmaurs have shown
that the fresh-water formation contains the seed of the pond-weed
<i>Potamogeton</i> and the aquatic Ranunculus; and Mr. Young of the
Glasgow Museum washed the mud adhering to the reindeer horns of
Kilmaurs and that which filled the cracks of the associated
elephants&rsquo; tusks, and detected in these fossils (which had been in
the Glasgow Museum for half a century) abundance of the same
seeds.</p>

<p>All doubts, therefore, as to the true position of the remains of
the mammoth, a fossil so rare in Scotland, have been set at rest,
and it serves to prove that part of the ancient continent sank
beneath the sea at a period of great cold, as the shells of the
overlying sand attest. The incumbent till or boulder clay is about
40 feet thick, but it often attains much greater thickness in the
same part of Scotland.</p>

<p>clay is at Airdie, in Lanarkshire, ten miles east of Glasgow,
524 feet above the level of the sea. At that spot they were found
imbedded in stratified clays with till above and below them. There
appears no doubt that the overlying deposit was true glacial till,
as some boulders of granite were observed in it, which must have
come from distances of sixty miles at the least.</p>

<p>The shells figured in Figs. 107 to 112 are only a few out of a
large assemblage of living species, which, taken as a whole, bear
testimony to conditions far more arctic than those now prevailing
in the Scottish seas. But a group of marine shells, indicating a
still greater excess of cold, has been brought to light since 1860
by the Reverend Thomas Brown, from glacial drift or clay on the
borders of the estuaries of the Forth and Tay. This clay occurs at
Elie, in Fife, and at Errol, in Perthshire; and has already
afforded about 35 shells, all of living species, and now
inhabitants of arctic regions, such as <i>Leda truncata, Tellina
proxima</i> (see Figs. 113 and 114), <i>Pecten Gr&oelig;nlandicus,
Crenella l&aelig;vigata, Crenella nigra,</i> and others, some of
them first brought by Captain Sir E. Parry from the coast of
Melville Island, latitude 76&deg; N. These were all identified in
1863 by Dr. Torell, who had just returned from a survey of the seas
around Spitzbergen, where he had collected no less than 150 species
of mollusca, living chiefly on a bottom of fine mud derived from
the moraines of melting glaciers which there protrude into the sea.
He informed me that the fossil fauna of this Scotch glacial deposit
exhibits not only the species but also the peculiar varieties of
mollusca now characteristic of very high latitudes. Their large
size implies that they formerly enjoyed a colder, or, what was to
them a more genial climate, than that now prevailing in the
latitude where the fossils occur. Marine shells have also been
found in the glacial drift of Caithness and Aberdeenshire at
heights of 250 feet, and in Banff of 350 feet, and stratified drift
continuous with the above ascends to heights of 500 feet. Already
75 species are enumerated</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 178">[ 178 ]</a></p>

<p>from Caithness, and the same number from Aberdeenshire and
Banff, and in both cases all but six are arctic species.</p>

<p>I formerly suggested that the absence of all signs of organic
life in the Scotch drift might be connected with the severity of
the cold, and also in some places with the depth of the sea during
the period of extreme submergence; but my faith in such an
hypothesis has been shaken by modern investigations, an exuberance
of life having been observed both in arctic and antarctic seas of
great depth, and where floating ice abounds. The difficulty,
moreover, of accounting for the entire dearth of marine shells in
till is removed when once we have adopted the theory of this
boulder clay being the product of land-ice. For glaciers coming
down from a continental ice-sheet like that which covers Greenland
may fill friths many hundred feet below the sea-level, and even
invade parts of a bay a thousand feet deep, before they find water
enough to float off their terminal portions in the form of
icebergs. In such a case till without marine shells may first
accumulate, and then, if the climate becomes warmer and the ice
melts, a marine deposit may be superimposed on the till without any
change of level being required.</p>

<p>Another curious phenomenon bearing on this subject was styled by
the late Hugh Miller the &ldquo;striated pavements&rdquo; of the boulder clay.
Where portions of the till have been removed by the sea on the
shores of the Forth, or in the interior by railway cuttings, the
boulders imbedded in what remains of the drift are seen to have
been all subjected to a process of abrasion and striation, the
stri&aelig; and furrows being parallel and persistent across them
all, exactly as if a glacier or iceberg had passed over them and
scored them in a manner similar to that so often undergone by the
solid rocks below the glacial drift. It is possible, as Mr. Geikie
conjectures, that this second striation of the boulders may be
referable to floating ice.*</p>

<p><i>Contorted Strata in Drift.</i>&mdash;In Scotland the till is
often covered with stratified gravel, sand, and clay, the beds of
which are sometimes horizontal and sometimes contorted for a
thickness of several feet. Such contortions are not uncommon in
Forfarshire, where I observed them, among other places, in a
vertical cutting made in 1840 near the left bank of the South Esk,
east of the bridge of Cortachie. The convolutions of the beds of
fine and coarse sand, gravel, and loam, extend through a thickness
of no less than 25 feet vertical, or from <i>b</i> to <i>c</i>,
Fig. 115, the horizontal stratification being resumed very abruptly
at a short distance, as to the right</p>

<p>of <i>f</i>, <i>g.</i> The overlying coarse gravel and sand, <i>
a</i>, is in some places horizontal, in others it exhibits cross
bedding, and does not partake of the disturbances which the strata
<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, have undergone. The underlying till is exposed
for a depth of about 20 feet; and we may infer from sections in the
neighbourhood that it is considerably thicker.</p>

<p>In some cases I have seen fragments of stratified clays and
sands, bent in like manner, in the middle of a great mass of till.
Mr. Trimmer has suggested, in explanation of such phenomena, the
intercalation in the glacial period of large irregular masses of
snow or ice between layers of sand and gravel. Some of the cliffs
near Behring&rsquo;s Straits, in which the remains of elephants occur,
consist of ice mixed with mud and stones; and Middendorf describes
the occurrence in Siberia of masses of ice, found at various depths
from the surface after digging through drift. Whenever the
intercalation of snow and ice with drift, whether stratified or
unstratified, has taken place, the melting of the ice will cause
such a failure of support as may give rise to flexures, and
sometimes to the most complicated foldings. But in many cases the
strata may have been bent and deranged by the mechanical pressure
of an advancing glacier, or by the sideway thrust of huge islands
of ice running aground against sandbanks; in which case, the
position of the beds forming the foundation of the banks may not be
at all disturbed by the shock.</p>

<p>There are indeed many signs in Scotland of the action of
floating ice, as might have been expected where proofs of
submergence in the Glacial Period are not wanting. Among these are
the occurrence of large erratic blocks, frequently in clusters at
or near the tops of hills or ridges, places which may have formed
islets or shallows in the sea where floating ice would mostly
ground and discharge its cargo on</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 180">[ 180 ]</a></p>

<p>melting. Glaciers or land-ice would, on the contrary, chiefly
discharge their cargoes at the bottom of valleys. Traces of an
earlier and independent glaciation have also been observed in some
regions where the striation, apparently produced by ice proceeding
from the north-west, is not explicable by the radiation of land-ice
from a central mountainous region.*</p>

<p><b>Glaciation of Wales and England.</b>&mdash;The mountains of
North Wales were recognised, in 1842, by Dr. Buckland, as having
been an independent centre of the dispersion of
erratics&mdash;great glaciers, long since extinct, having radiated
from the Snowdonian heights in Carnarvonshire, through seven
principal valleys towards as many points of the compass, carrying
with them large stony fragments, and grooving the subjacent rocks
in as many directions.</p>

<p>Besides this evidence of land-glaciers, Mr. Trimmer had
previously, in 1831, detected the signs of a great submergence in
Wales in the Post-pliocene period. He had observed stratified
drift, from which he obtained about a dozen species of marine
shells, near the summit of Moel Tryfaen, a hill 1400 feet high, on
the south side of the Menai Straits. I had an opportunity of
examining in the summer of 1863, together with the Reverend W. S.
Symonds, a long and deep cutting made through this drift by the
Alexandra Mining Company in search of slates. At the top of the
hill above-mentioned we saw a stratified mass of incoherent sand
and gravel 35 feet thick, from which no less than 54 species of
mollusca, besides three characteristic arctic varieties&mdash;in
all 57 forms&mdash;have been obtained by Mr. Darbishire. They
belong without exception to species still living in British or more
northern seas; eleven of them being exclusively arctic, four common
to the arctic and British seas, and a large proportion of the
remainder having a northward range, or, if found at all in the
southern seas of Britain, being comparatively less abundant. In the
lowest beds of the drift were large heavy boulders of
far-transported rocks, glacially polished and scratched on more
than one side. Underneath the whole we saw the edges of vertical
slates exposed to view, which here, like the rocks in other parts
of Wales, both at greater and less elevations, exhibit beneath the
drift unequivocal marks of prolonged glaciation. The whole deposit
has much the appearance of an accumulation in shallow water or on a
beach, and it probably acquired its thickness during the gradual
subsidence of the coast&mdash;an hypothesis which would require us
to ascribe to it a high antiquity,</p>

xxv, 1868-9.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 181">[ 181 ]</a></p>

<p>since we must allow time, first for its sinking, and then for
its re-elevation.</p>

<p>The height reached by these fossil shells on Moel Tryfaen is no
less than 1300 feet&mdash;a most important fact when we consider
how very few instances we have on record beyond the limits of
Wales, whether in Europe or North America, of marine shells having
been found in glacial drift at half the height above indicated. A
marine molluscous fauna, however, agreeing in character with that
of Moel Tryfaen, and comprising as many species, has been found in
drift at Macclesfield and other places in central England,
sometimes reaching an elevation of 1200 feet.</p>

<p>Professor Ramsay* estimated the probable amount of submergence
during some part of the glacial period at about 2300 feet; for he
was unable to distinguish the superficial sands and gravel which
reached that high elevation from the drift which, at Moel Tryfaen
and at lower points, contains shells of living species. The
evidence of the marine origin of the highest drift is no doubt
inconclusive in the absence of shells, so great is the resemblance
of the gravel and sand of a sea beach and of a river&rsquo;s bed, when
organic remains are wanting; but, on the other hand, when we
consider the general rarity of shells in drift which we know to be
of marine origin, we can not suppose that, in the shelly sands of
Moel Tryfaen, we have hit upon the exact uppermost limit of marine
deposition, or, in other words, a precise measure of the
submergence of the land beneath the sea since the glacial
period.</p>

<p>We are gradually obtaining proofs of the larger part of England,
north of a line drawn from the mouth of the Thames to the Bristol
Channel, having been under the sea and traversed by floating ice
since the commencement of the glacial epoch. Among recent
observations illustrative of this point, I may allude to the
discovery, by Mr. J. F. Bateman, near Blackpool, in Lancashire,
fifty miles from the sea, and at the height of 568 feet above its
level, of till containing rounded and angular stones and marine
shells, such as <i>Turritella communis, Purpura lapillus, Cardium
edule,</i> and others, among which <i>Trophon clathratum</i>
(=<i>Fusus Bamffius</i>), though still surviving in North British
seas, indicates a cold climate.</p>

<p><i>Erratics near Chichester.</i>&mdash;The most southern
memorials of ice-action and of a Post-pliocene fauna in Great
Britain is on the coast of the county of Sussex, about 25 miles
west of Brighton, and 15 south of Chichester. A marine deposit
exposed between high and low tide occurs on both sides of the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 182">[ 182 ]</a></p>

<p>promontory called Selsea Bill, in which Mr. Godwin-Austen found
thirty-eight species of shells, and the number has since been
raised to seventy.</p>

<p>This assemblage is interesting because on the whole, while all
the species are recent, they have a somewhat more southern aspect
than those of the present British Channel. It is true that about
forty of them range from British to high northern latitudes; but
several of them, as, for example, <i>Lutraria rugosa</i> and <i>
Pecten polymorphous</i>, which are abundant, are not known at
present to range farther north than the coast of Portugal, and seem
to indicate a warmer temperature than now prevails on the coast
where we find them fossil. What renders this curious is the fact
that the sandy loam in which they occur is overlaid by yellow
clayey gravel with large erratic blocks which must have been
drifted into their present position by ice when the climate had
become much colder. These transported fragments of granite,
syenite, and greenstone, as well as of Devonian and Silurian rocks,
may have come from the coast of Normandy and Brittany, and are many
of them of such large size that we must suppose them to have been
drifted into their present site by coast-ice. I measured one of
granite, at Pagham, 21 feet in circumference. In the gravel of this
drift with erratics are a few littoral shells of living species,
indicating an ancient coast-line.</p>

<p><b>Glacial Formations of North America.</b>&mdash;In the western
hemisphere, both in Canada and as far south as the 40th and even
38th parallel of latitude in the United States, we meet with a
repetition of all the peculiarities which distinguish the European
boulder formation. Fragments of rock have travelled for great
distances, especially from north to south: the surface of the
subjacent rock is smoothed, striated, and fluted; unstratified mud
or <i>till</i> containing boulders is associated with strata of
loam, sand, and clay, usually devoid of fossils. Where shells are
present, they are of species still living in northern seas, and not
a few of them identical with those belonging to European drift,
including most of those already given in Figs. 107 to 112, p. 176.
The fauna also of the glacial epoch in North America is less rich
in species than that now inhabiting the adjacent sea, whether in
the Gulf of St. Lawrence, or off the shores of Maine, or in the Bay
of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The extension on the American continent of the range of erratics
during the Post-pliocene period to lower latitudes than they
reached in Europe, agrees well with the present southward
deflection of the isothermal lines, or rather the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 183">[ 183 ]</a></p>

<p>lines of equal winter temperature. It seems that formerly, as
now, a more extreme climate and a more abundant supply of ice
prevailed on the western side of the Atlantic. Another resemblance
between the distribution of the drift fossils in Europe and North
America has yet to be pointed out. In Canada and the United States,
as in Europe, the marine shells are generally confined to very
moderate elevations above the sea (between 100 and 700 feet), while
the erratic blocks and the grooved and polished surfaces of rock
extend to elevations of several thousand feet.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that in Europe several quadrupeds of
living, as well as extinct, species were common to pre-glacial and
post-glacial times. In like manner there is reason to suppose that
in North America much of the ancient mammalian fauna, together with
nearly all the invertebrata, lived through the ages of intense
cold. That in the United States the <i>Mastodon giganteus</i> was
very abundant after the drift period, is evident from the fact that
entire skeletons of this animal are met with in bogs and lacustrine
deposits occupying hollows in the glacial drift. They sometimes
occur in the bottom even of small ponds recently drained by the
agriculturist for the sake of the shell-marl. In 1845 no less than
six skeletons of the same species of Mastodon were found in Warren
county, New Jersey, six feet below the surface, by a farmer who was
digging out the rich mud from a small pond which he had drained.
Five of these skeletons were lying together, and a large part of
the bones crumbled to pieces as soon as they were exposed to the
air.</p>

<p>It would be rash, however, to infer from such data that these
quadrupeds were mired in <i>modern</i> times, unless we use that
term strictly in a geological sense. I have shown that there is a
fluviatile deposit in the valley of the Niagara, containing shells
of the genera <i>Melania, Lymnea, Planorbis, Velvata, Cyclaz, Unio,
Helix,</i> etc., all of recent species, from which the bones of the
great Mastodon have been taken in a very perfect state. Yet the
whole excavation of the ravine, for many miles below the Falls, has
been slowly effected since that fluviatile deposit was thrown down.
Other extinct animals accompany the <i>Mastodon giganteus</i> in
the post-glacial deposits of the United States, and this, taken
with the fact that so few of the mollusca, even of the commencement
of the cold period, differ from species now living is important, as
refuting the hypothesis, for which some have contended, that the
intensity of the glacial cold annihilated all the species in
temperate and arctic latitudes.</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 184">[ 184 ]</a></p>

<p><b>Connection of the Predominance of Lakes with Glacial
Action.</b>&mdash;It was first pointed out by Professor Ramsay in
1862, that lakes are exceedingly numerous in those countries where
erratics, striated blocks, and other signs of ice-action abound;
and that they are comparatively rare in tropical and sub-tropical
regions. Generally in countries where the winter cold is intense,
such as Canada, Scandinavia, and Finland, even the plains and
lowlands are thickly strewn with innumerable ponds and small lakes,
together with some others of a larger size; while in more temperate
regions, such as Great Britain, Central and Southern Europe, the
United States, and New Zealand, lake districts occur in all such
mountainous tracts as can be proved to have been glaciated in times
comparatively modern or since the geographical configuration of the
surface bore a considerable resemblance to that now prevailing. In
the same countries, beyond the glaciated regions, lakes abruptly
cease, and in warmer and tropical countries are either entirely
absent, or consist, as in equatorial Africa, of large sheets of
water unaccompanied so far as we yet know by numerous smaller ponds
and tarns.</p>

<p>The southern limits of the lake districts of the Northern
Hemisphere are found at about 40&deg; N. latitude on the American
continent, and about 50&deg; in Europe, or where the Alps intervene
four degrees farther south. A large proportion of the smaller lakes
are dammed up by barriers of unstratified drift, having the exact
character of the moraines of glaciers, and are termed by geologists
&ldquo;morainic,&rdquo; but some of them are true rock-basins, and would hold
water even if all the loose drift now resting on their margins were
removed.</p>

<p>In a paper read before the Geological Society of London in 1862,
Professor Ramsay maintained that the first formation of most
existing lakes took place during the glacial epoch, and was due,
not to elevation or subsidence, but to actual erosion of their
basins by glaciers. M. Mortillet in the same year advanced the
theory that after the Alpine lake-basins had been filled up with
loose fluviatile deposits, they were re-excavated by the great
glaciers which passed down the valleys at the time of the greatest
cold, a doctrine which would attribute to moving ice almost as
great a capacity of erosion as that which assumed that the original
basins were scooped out of solid rock by glaciers. It is impossible
to deny that the mere geographical distribution of lakes points to
the intimate connection of their origin with the abundance of ice
during a former excess of cold, but how far the erosive action of
moving ice has been the sole or even the</p>

<p>principal cause of lake-basins, is a question still open to
discussion.</p>

<p>The lakes of Switzerland and the north of Italy are some of them
twenty and thirty miles in length, and so deep that their bottoms
are in some cases from 1000 to 2000 feet beneath the level of the
sea. It is admitted on all hands that they were once filled with
ice, and as the existing glaciers polish and grind down, as before
stated, the surface of the rocks, we are prepared to find that
every lake-basin in countries once covered by ice should bear the
marks of superficial glaciation, and also that the ice during its
advance and retreat should have left behind it much transported
matter as well as some evidence of its having enlarged the
pre-existing cavity. But much more than this is demanded by the
advocates of glacial erosion. They suggest that as the old extinct
glaciers were several thousand feet thick, they were able in some
places gradually to scoop out of the solid rock cavities twenty or
thirty miles in length, and as in the case of Lago Maggiore from a
thousand to two thousand six hundred feet below the previous level
of the river-channel, and also that the ice had the power to remove
from the cavity formed by its grinding action all the materials of
the missing rocks. A constant supply, it is argued, of fine mud
issues from the termination of every glacier in the stream which is
produced by the melting of the ice, and this result of friction is
exhibited both during winter and summer, affording evidence of the
continual deepening and widening of the valleys through which
glaciers pass. As the fine mud is carried away by a river from the
deep pool which is formed from the base of every cataract, so it
seems to be imagined that lake-basins may be gradually emptied of
the mud formed by abrasion during the glacial period.</p>

<p>I am by no means disposed to object to this theory on the ground
of the insufficiency of the time during which the extreme cold
endured, but we must carefully consider whether that same time is
not so vast as to make it probable that other forces, besides the
motion of glaciers, must have cooperated in converting some parts
of the ancient valley courses into lake-basins. They who have
formed the most exalted conceptions of the erosive energy of moving
ice do not deny that during the period termed &ldquo;Glacial&rdquo; there have
been movements of the earth&rsquo;s crust sufficient to produce
oscillations of level in Europe amounting to 1000 feet or more in
both directions. M. Charpentier, indeed, attributed some of the
principal changes of climate in Switzerland, during the glacial
period, to a depression of the central Alps to the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 186">[ 186 ]</a></p>

<p>extent of 3000 feet, and Swiss geologists have long been
accustomed to attribute their lake basins, in part, to those
convulsions by which the shape and course of the valleys may have
been modified. Our experience, in the lifetime of the present
generation, of the changes of level witnessed in New Zealand during
great earthquakes is entirely opposed to the notion that the
movements, whether upward or downward, are uniform in amount or
direction throughout areas of indefinite extent. On the contrary,
the land has been permanently raised in one region several feet or
yards, and the rise has been found gradually to die out, so as to
be imperceptible at a distance of twenty miles, and in some areas
is even exchanged for a simultaneous downward movement of several
feet.</p>

<p>But, it is asked, if such inequality of movement can have
contributed towards the production of lake basins, does it not
leave unexplained the comparative rarity of lakes in tropical and
subtropical countries. In reply to this question it may be observed
that in our endeavour to estimate the effects of subterranean
movements in modifying the superficial geography of a country we
must remember that each convulsion effects a very slight change. If
it interferes with the drainage, whether by raising the lower or
sinking the higher portion of a hydrographical basin, the upheaval
or depression will only amount to a few feet at a time, and there
may be an interval of years or centuries before any further
movement takes place in the same region. In the mean time an
incipient lake if produced may be filled up with sediment, and the
recently-formed barrier will then be cut through by the river,
whereas in a country where glacial conditions prevail no such
obliteration of the temporary lake-basin would take place; for
however deep it became by repeated sinking of the upper or rising
of the lower extremity, being always filled with ice it might
remain, throughout the greater part of its extent, free from
sediment or drift until the ice melted at the close of the glacial
period.</p>

<p>One of the most serious objections to the exclusive origin by
ice-erosion of wide and deep lake-basins arises from their
capricious distribution, as for example in Piedmont, both to the
eastward and westward of Turin, where great lakes are wanting,*
although some of the largest extinct glaciers descending from Mont
Blanc and Monte Rosa came down from the Alps, leaving their
gigantic moraines in the low country. Here, therefore, we might
have expected to find lakes of the first magnitude rivalling the
contiguous Lago Maggiore in importance.</p>

<p>A still more striking illustration of the same absence of lakes
where large glaciers abound is afforded by the Caucasus, a chain
more than 300 miles long, and the loftiest peaks of which attain
heights from 16,000 to 18,000 feet. This greatest altitude is
reached by Elbruz, a mountain in lat. 43&deg; N. three degrees
south of Mont Blanc, but on the other hand 3000 feet higher. The
present Caucasian glaciers are equal or superior in dimensions to
those of Switzerland, and like them give rise occasionally to
temporary lakes by obstructing the course of rivers, and causing
great floods when the icy barriers give way. Mr. Freshfield, a
careful observer, writing in 1869, says:* &ldquo;A total absence of lakes
on both sides of the chains is the most marked feature. Not only
are there no great subalpine sheets of water, like Como or Geneva,
but mountain tarns, such as the Dauben See on the Gemmi, or the
Klonthal See near Glarus, are equally wanting.&rdquo; The same author
states on the authority of the eminent Swiss geologist, Mons. E.
Favre, who also explored the Caucasus in 1868, that moraines of
great height and huge erratics of granite and other rocks &ldquo;justify
the assertion that the present glaciers of the Caucasus, like those
of the Alps, are only the shadows of their former selves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seems safe to assume that the chain of lakes, of which the
Albert Nyanza forms one in equatorial Africa, was due to causes
other than glacial. Yet if we could imagine a glacial period to
visit that region filling the lakes with ice and scoring the rocks
which form their sides and bottoms, we should be unable to decide
how much the capacity of the basins had been enlarged and the
surface modified by glacial erosion. The same may be true of the
Lago Maggiore and Lake Superior, although the present basins of
both of them afford abundant superficial markings due to
ice-action.</p>

<p>But to whatever combination of causes we attribute the great
Alpine lakes one thing is clear, namely, that they are,
geologically speaking, of modern origin. Every one must admit that
the upper valley of the Rhone has been chiefly caused by fluviatile
denudation, and it is obvious that the quantity of matter removed
from that valley previous to the glacial period would have been
amply sufficient to fill up with sediment the basin of the Lake of
Geneva, supposing it to have been in existence, even if its
capacity had been many times greater than it is now.&dagger;</p>

<p>On the whole, it appears to me, in accordance with the views of
Professor Ramsay, M. Mortillet, Mr. Geikie, and others,</p>

<p>that the abrading action of ice has formed some mountain tarns
and many morainic lakes; but when it is a question of the origin of
larger and deeper lakes, like those of Switzerland or the north of
Italy, or inland fresh-water seas, like those of Canada, it will
probably be found that ice has played a subordinate part in
comparison with those movements by which changes of level in the
earth&rsquo;s crust are gradually brought about.</p>
