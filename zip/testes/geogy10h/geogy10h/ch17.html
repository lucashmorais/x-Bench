<p>We have treated in the preceding chapters of the Tertiary or
Cainozoic strata, and have next to speak of the Secondary or
Mesozoic formations. The uppermost of these last is commonly called
the chalk or the cretaceous formation, from creta, the latin name
for that remarkable white earthy limestone, which constitutes an
upper member of the group in those parts of Europe where it was
first studied. The marked discordance in the fossils of the
tertiary, as compared with the cretaceous formations, has long
induced many geologists to suspect that an indefinite series of
ages elapsed between the respective periods of their origin.
Measured, indeed, by such a standard, that is to say, by the amount
of change in the Fauna and Flora of the earth effected in the
interval, the time between the Cretaceous and Eocene may have been
as great as that between the Eocene and Recent periods, to the
history of which the last seven chapters have been devoted. Several
deposits have been met with here and there, in the course of the
last half century, of an age intermediate between the white chalk
and the plastic clays and sands of the Paris and London districts,
monuments</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 282">[ 282 ]</a></p>

<p>which have the same kind of interest to a geologist which
certain medieval records excite when we study the history of
nations. For both of them throw light on ages of darkness, preceded
and followed by others of which the annals are comparatively
well-known to us. But these newly-discovered records do not fill up
the wide gap, some of them being closely allied to the Eocene, and
others to the Cretaceous type, while none appear as yet to possess
so distinct and characteristic a fauna as may entitle them to hold
an independent place in the great chronological series.</p>

<p>Among the formations alluded to, the Thanet Sands of Prestwich
have been sufficiently described in the last chapter, and classed
as Lower Eocene. To the same tertiary series belong the Belgian
formations, called by Professor Dumont, Landenian. On the other
hand, the Maestricht and Faxoe limestones are very closely
connected with the chalk, to which also the Pisolitic limestone of
France is referable.</p>

<p><b>Classification of the Cretaceous Rocks.</b>&mdash;The
cretaceous group has generally been divided into an Upper and a
Lower series, the Upper called familiarly <i>the chalk,</i> and the
Lower <i>the greensand</i>; the one deriving its name from the
predominance of white earthy limestone and marl, of which it
consists in a great part of France and England, the other or lower
series from the plentiful mixture of green or chloritic grains
contained in some of the sands and cherts of which it largely
consists in the same countries. But these mineral characters often
fail, even when we attempt to follow out the same continuous
subdivisions throughout a small portion of the north of Europe, and
are worse than valueless when we desire to apply them to more
distant regions. It is only by aid of the organic remains which
characterise the successive marine subdivisions of the formation
that we are able to recognise in remote countries, such as the
south of Europe or North America, the formations which were there
contemporaneously in progress. To the English student of geology it
will be sufficient to begin by enumerating those groups which
characterise the series in this country and others immediately
contiguous, alluding but slightly to those of more distant regions.
In the table (p. 283) it will be seen that I have used the term
Neocomian for that commonly called &ldquo;Lower Greensand;&rdquo;
as this latter term is peculiarly objectionable, since the green
grains are an exception to the rule in many of the members of this
group even in districts where it was first studied and named.</p>

"Belemnitella mucronata." align="right"> 

<p><i>Maestricht Beds.</i>&mdash;On the banks of the Meuse, at
Maestricht, reposing on ordinary white chalk with flints, we find
an upper calcareous formation about 100 feet thick, the fossils of
which are, on the whole, very peculiar, and all distinct from
tertiary species. Some few are of species common to the inferior
white chalk, among which may be mentioned <i>Belemnitella
mucronata</i> (Fig. 226) and <i>Pecten quadricostatus,</i> a shell
regarded by many as a mere variety of <i>P. quinquecostatus</i>
(see <a href="images2/fig270.jpg">Fig. 270</a>). Besides the
Belemnite there are other <i>genera,</i> such as <i>Baculites</i>
and <i>Hamites,</i> never found in strata newer than the
cretaceous, but frequently met with in these Maestricht beds. On
the other hand, <i>Voluta, Fasciolaria,</i> and other genera of
univalve shells, usually met with only in tertiary strata,
occur.</p>

<p>The upper part of the rock, about 20 feet thick, as seen in St.
Peter&rsquo;s Mount, in the suburbs of Maestricht, abounds in
corals and Bryozoa, often detachable from the matrix; and these
beds are succeeded by a soft yellowish limestone 50 feet thick,
extensively quarried from time immemorial for building. The stone
below is whiter, and contains occasional nodules of grey chert or
chalcedony.</p>

<p>M. Bosquet, with whom I examined this formation (August, 1850),
pointed out to me a layer of chalk from two to four inches thick,
containing green earth and numerous encrinital stems, which forms
the line of demarkation between the strata containing the fossils
peculiar to Maestricht and</p>

<p>the white chalk below. The latter is distinguished by regular
layers of black flint in nodules, and by several shells, such as
<i>Terebratula carnea</i> (see <a href="images2/fig240.jpg">Fig.
246</a>), wholly wanting in beds higher than the green band. Some
of the organic remains, however, for which St. Peter&rsquo;s Mount
is celebrated, occur both above and below that parting layer, and,
among others, the great marine reptile called <i>Mosasaurus</i>
(see Fig. 227), a saurian supposed to have been 24 feet in length,
of which the entire skull and a great part of the skeleton have
been found. Such remains are chiefly met with in the soft
freestone, the principal member of the Maestricht beds. Among the
fossils common to the Maestricht and white chalk may be instanced
the echinoderm, Fig. 228.</p>

<img src="images2/fig228.jpg" width="164" height="180" alt=
"Hemipneustes radiatus." align="left"> 

<p>I saw proofs of the previous denudation of the white chalk
exhibited in the lower bed of the Maestricht formation in Belgium,
about 30 miles S.W. of Maestricht, at the village of Jendrain,
where the base of the newer deposit consisted chiefly of a layer of
well-rolled, black chalk-flint pebbles, in the midst of which
perfect specimens of <i>Thecidea papillata</i> and <i>Belemnitella
mucronata</i> are imbedded. To a geologist accustomed in England to
regard rolled pebbles of chalk-flint as a common and distinctive
feature of tertiary beds of different ages, it is a new and
surprising phenomenon to behold strata made up of such materials,
and yet to feel no doubt that they were</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 285">[ 285 ]</a></p>

<p>accumulated in a sea in which the belemnite and other cretaceous
mollusca flourished.</p>

<p><b>Pisolitic Limestone of France.</b>&mdash;Geologists were for
many years at variance respecting the chronological relations of
this rock, which is met with in the neighbourhood of Paris, and at
places north, south, east, and west of that metropolis, as between
Vertus and Laversines, Meudon and Montereau. By many able
pal&aelig;ontologists the species of fossils, more than fifty in
number, were declared to be more Eocene in their appearance than
Cretaceous. But M. H&eacute;bert found in this formation at
Montereau, near Paris, the <i>Pecten quadricostatus,</i> a
well-known Cretaceous species, together with some other fossils
common to the Maestricht chalk and to the Baculite limestone of the
Cotentin, in Normandy. He therefore, as well as M. Alcide
d&rsquo;Orbigny, who had carefully studied the fossils, came to the
opinion that it was an upper member of the Cretaceous group. It is
usually in the form of a coarse yellowish or whitish limestone, and
the total thickness of the series of beds already known is about
100 feet. Its geographical range, according to M. H&eacute;bert, is
not less than 45 leagues from east to west, and 35 from north to
south. Within these limits it occurs in small patches only, resting
unconformably on the white chalk.</p>

<p>The <i>Nautilus Danicus,</i> <a href="images2/fig229.jpg">Fig.
230,</a> and two or three other species found in this rock, are
frequent in that of Faxoe, in Denmark, but as yet no Ammonites,
Hamites, Scaphites, Turrilites, Baculites, or Hippurites have been
met with. The proportion of peculiar species, many of them of
tertiary aspect, is confessedly large; and great aqueous erosion
suffered by the white chalk, before the pisolitic limestone was
formed, affords an additional indication of the two deposits being
widely separated in time. The pisolitic formation, therefore, may
eventually prove to be somewhat more intermediate in date between
the secondary and tertiary epochs than the Maestricht rock.</p>

<p><b>Chalk of Faxoe.</b>&mdash; In the island of Seeland, in
Denmark, the newest member of the chalk series, seen in the
sea-cliffs at Stevensklint resting on white chalk with flints, is a
yellow limestone, a portion of which, at Faxoe, where it is used as
a building stone, is composed of corals, even more conspicuously
than is usually observed in recent coral reefs. It has been
quarried to the depth of more than 40 feet, but its thickness is
unknown. The imbedded shells are chiefly casts, many of them of
univalve mollusca, which are usually very rare in the white chalk
of Europe. Thus, there are two species of <i>Cypr&aelig;a,</i> one
of <i>Oliva,</i> two of <i>Mitra,</i> four of the genus</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 286">[ 286 ]</a></p>

<p><i>Cerithium,</i> six of <i>Fusus,</i> two of <i>Trochus,</i>
one of <i>Patella,</i> one of <i>Emarginula,</i> etc.; on the
whole, more than thirty univalves, spiral or patelliform. At the
same time, some of the accompanying bivalve shells, echinoderms,
and zoophytes, are specifically identical with fossils of the true
Cretaceous series. Among the cephalopoda of Faxoe may be mentioned
<i>Baculites Faujasii</i> (Fig. 229), and <i>Belemnitella
mucronata</i> (<a href="images2/fig226.jpg">Fig. 226</a>), shells
of the white chalk. The <i>Nautilus Danicus</i> (see Fig. 230) is
characteristic of this formation; and it also occurs in France in
the calcaire pisolitique of Laversin (Department of Oise). The
claws and entire skull of a small crab, <i>Brachyurus rugosus</i>
(Schlott.), are scattered through the Faxoe stone, reminding us of
similar crustaceans inclosed in the rocks of modern coral reefs.
Some small portions of this coralline formation consist of white
earthy chalk.</p>

<p><b>Composition, Extent and Origin of the White
Chalk.</b>&mdash;The highest beds of chalk in England and France
consist of a pure, white, calcareous mass, usually too soft for a
building-stone, but sometimes passing into a more solid state. It
consists, almost purely, of carbonate of lime; the stratification
is often obscure, except where rendered distinct by interstratified
layers of flint, a few inches thick, occasionally in continuous
beds, but oftener in nodules, and recurring at intervals generally
from two to four feet distant from each other. This upper chalk is
usually succeeded, in the descending order, by a great mass of
white chalk without flints, below which comes the chalk marl, in
which there is a slight admixture of argillaceous matter. The
united thickness of the three divisions in the south of England
equals, in some places, 1000 feet. The section in <a href=
"images2/fig231.jpg">Fig. 231</a> will show the manner in which the
white chalk extends from England into France, covered by the
tertiary strata described in former chapters, and reposing on lower
cretaceous beds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 287">[ 287 ]</a></p>

<p>The area over which the white chalk preserves a nearly
homogeneous aspect is so vast, that the earlier geologists
despaired of discovering any analogous deposits of recent date.
Pure chalk, of nearly uniform aspect and composition, is met with
in a north-west and south-east direction, from the north of Ireland
to the Crimea, a distance of about 1140 geographical miles, and in
an opposite direction it extends from the south of Sweden to the
south of Bordeaux, a distance of about 840 geographical miles. In
Southern Russia, according to Sir R. Murchison, it is sometimes 600
feet thick, and retains the same mineral character as in France and
England, with the same fossils, including <i>Inoceramus Cuvieri,
Belemnitella mucronata,</i> and <i>Ostrea vesicularis</i> (<a href=
"images2/fig251.jpg">Fig. 251).</a></p>

"Diagrammatic section from Hertfordshire, in England, to Sens, in France.">
</center>

<p>Great light has recently been thrown upon the origin of the
unconsolidated white chalk by the deep soundings made in the North
Atlantic, previous to laying down, in 1858, the electric telegraph
between Ireland and Newfoundland. At depths sometimes exceeding two
miles, the mud forming the floor of the ocean was found, by
Professor Huxley, to be almost entirely composed (more than
nineteen-twentieths of the whole) of minute Rhizopods, or
foraminiferous shells of the genus Globigerina, especially the
species <i>Globigerina bulloides</i> (see <a href=
"images2/fig232.jpg">Fig. 232.</a>) the organic bodies next in
quantity were the siliceous shells called <i>
Polycystine&aelig;,</i> and next to them the siliceous skeletons of
plants called <i>Diatomace&aelig;</i> (<a href=
"images2/fig232.jpg">Figs. 233, 234, 235</a>), and occasionally
some siliceous spicul&aelig; of sponges (<a href=
"images2/fig232.jpg">Fig. 236</a>) were intermixed. These were
connected by a mass of living gelatinous matter to which he has
given the name of <i>Bathybius,</i> and which contains abundance of
very minute bodies termed Coccoliths and Coccospheres, which have
also been detected fossil in chalk.</p>

<p>Sir Leopold MacClintock and Dr. Wallich have ascertained that 95
per cent of the mud of a large part of the North Atlantic consists
of Globigerina shells. But Captain Bullock, <small>R.N.</small>,
lately brought up from the enormous depth of 16,860 feet a
white,</p>

</center>

<p>viscid, chalky mud, wholly devoid of Globigerin&aelig;. This mud
was perfectly homogeneous in composition, and contained no organic
remains visible to the naked eye. Mr. Etheridge, however, has
ascertained by microscopical examination that it is made up of <i>
Coccoliths, Discoliths,</i> and other minute fossils like those of
the Chalk classed by Huxley as <i>Bathybius,</i> when this term is
used in its widest sense. This mud, more than three miles deep, was
dredged up in latitude 20&deg; 19' N., longitude 4&deg; 36' E., or
about midway between Madeira and the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>The recent deep-sea dredgings in the Atlantic conducted by Dr.
Wyville Thomson, Dr. Carpenter, Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys, and others, have
shown that on the same white mud there sometimes flourish Mollusca,
Crustacea, and Echinoderms, besides abundance of siliceous sponges,
forming, on the whole, a marine fauna bearing a striking
resemblance in its general character to that of the ancient
chalk.</p>

<p><b>Popular Error as to the Geological Continuity of the
Cretaceous Period.</b>&mdash;We must be careful, however, not to
overrate the points of resemblance which the deep-sea
investigations have placed in a strong light. They have been
supposed by some naturalists to warrant a conclusion expressed in
these words: &ldquo;We are still living in the Cretaceous
epoch;&rdquo; a doctrine which has led to much popular delusion as
to the bearing of the new facts on geological reasoning and
classification. The reader should be reminded that in geology we
have been in the habit of founding our great chronological
divisions, not on foraminifera and sponges, nor even on echinoderms
and corals, but on the remains of the most highly organised beings
available to us, such as the mollusca; these being met with, as
explained (<a href="ch9.html#page 142">p. 142</a>), in stratified
rocks of almost every age. In dealing with the mollusca, it is
those of the highest or most specialised organisation, which afford
us the best characters in proportion as their vertical range is the
most limited. Thus the Cephalopoda</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 289">[ 289 ]</a></p>

<p>are the most valuable, as having a more restricted range in time
than the Gasteropoda; and these, again, are more characteristic of
the particular stratigraphical subdivisions than are the
Lamellibranchiate Bivalves, while these last, again, are more
serviceable in classification than the Brachiopoda, a still lower
class of shell-fish, which are the most enduring of all.</p>

<p>When told that the new dredgings prove that &ldquo;we are still
living in the Chalk Period,&rdquo; we naturally ask whether some
cuttle-fish has been found with a Belemnite forming part of its
internal framework; or have Ammonites, Baculites, Hamites,
Turrilites, with four or five other Cephalopodous genera
characteristic of the chalk and unknown as tertiary, been met with
in the abysses of the ocean? Or, in the absence of these
long-extinct forms, has a single spiral univalve, or species of
Cretaceous Gasteropod, been found living? Or, to descend still
lower in the scale, has some characteristic Cretaceous genus of
Lamellibranchiate Bivalve, such as the Inoceramus, or Hippurite,
foreign to the Tertiary seas, been proved to have survived down to
our time? Or, of the numerous genera of lamellibranchiates common
to the Cretaceous and Recent seas, has one species been found
living? The answer to all these questions is&mdash;not one has been
found. Even of the humblest shell-fish, the Brachiopods, no new
species common to the Cretaceous and recent seas has yet been met
with. It has been very generally admitted by conchologists that out
of a hundred species of this tribe occurring fossil in the Upper
Chalk&mdash;one, and one only, <i>Terebratulina striata,</i> is still
living, being thought to be identical with <i>Terebratula
caput-serpentis.</i> Although this identity is still questioned by
some naturalists of authority, it would certainly not surprise us
if another lamp-shell of equal antiquity should be met with in the
deep sea.</p>

<p>Had it been declared that we are living in the Eocene epoch, the
idea would not be so extravagant, for the great reptiles of the
Upper Chalk, the Mosasaurus, Pliosaurus, and Pterodactyle, and many
others, as well as so many genera of chambered univalves, had
already disappeared from the earth, and the marine fauna had made a
greater approach to our own by nearly the entire difference which
separates it from the fauna of the Cretaceous seas. The Eocene
nummulitic limestone of Egypt is a rock mainly composed, like the
more ancient white chalk, of globigerine mud; and if the reader
will refer to what we have said of the extent to which the
nummulitic marine strata, formed originally at the bottom of the
sea, now enter into the frame-work of</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 290">[ 290 ]</a></p>

<p>mountain chains of the principal continents, he will at once
perceive that the present Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans are
geographical terms, which must be wholly without meaning when
applied to the Eocene, and still more to the Cretaceous Period; so
that to talk of the chalk having been uninterruptedly forming in
the Atlantic from the Cretaceous Period to our own, is as
inadmissible in a geographical as in a geological sense.</p>

<p><b>Chalk-flints.</b>&mdash;The origin of the layers of flint,
whether in the form of nodules, or continuous sheets, or in veins
or cracks not parallel to the stratification, has always been more
difficult to explain than that of the white chalk. But here, again,
the late deep-sea soundings have suggested a possible source of
such mineral matter. During the cruise of the
&ldquo;Bulldog,&rdquo; already alluded to, it was ascertained that
while the calcareous <i>Globigerin&aelig;</i> had almost exclusive
possession of certain tracts of the sea-bottom, they were wholly
wanting in others, as between Greenland and Labrador. According to
Dr. Wallich, they may flourish in those spaces where they derive
nutriment from organic and other matter, brought from the south by
the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, and they may be absent where
the effects of that great current are not felt. Now, in several of
the spaces where the calcareous Rhizopods are wanting, certain
microscopic plants, called <i>Diatomace&aelig;,</i> above mentioned
(<a href="images2/fig232.jpg">Figs. 233-235</a>), the solid parts
of which are siliceous, monopolise the ground at a depth of nearly
400 fathoms, or 2400 feet.</p>

<p>The large quantities of silex in solution required for the
formation of these plants may probably arise from the
disintegration of feldspathic rocks, which are universally
distributed. As more than half of their bulk is formed of siliceous
earth, they may afford an endless supply of silica to all the great
rivers which flow into the ocean. We may imagine that, after a
lapse of many years or centuries, changes took place in the
direction of the marine currents, favouring at one time a supply in
the same area of siliceous, and at another of calcareous matter in
excess, giving rise in the one case to a preponderance of
Globigerin&aelig;, and in the other of Diatomace&aelig;. These
last, and certain sponges, may by their decomposition have
furnished the silex, which, separating from the chalky mud,
collected round organic bodies, or formed nodules, or filled
shrinkage cracks.</p>

<p><b>Pot-stones.</b>&mdash;A more difficult enigma is presented by
the occurrence of certain huge flints, or pot-stones, as they are
called in Norfolk, occurring singly, or arranged in nearly
continuous columns at right angles to the ordinary and</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 291">[ 291 ]</a></p>

<p>horizontal layers of small flints. I visited in the year 1825 an
extensive range of quarries then open on the river Bure, near
Horstead, about six miles from Norwich, which afforded a continuous
section, a quarter of a mile in length, of white chalk, exposed to
the depth of about twenty-six feet, and covered by a bed of gravel.
The pot-stones, many of them pear-shaped, were usually about three
feet in height and one foot in their transverse diameter, placed in
vertical rows, like pillars, at irregular distances from each
other, but usually from twenty to thirty feet apart, though
sometimes nearer together, as in Figure 237. These rows did not
terminate downward in any instance which I could examine, nor
upward, except at the point where they were cut off abruptly by the
bed of gravel. On breaking open the pot-stones, I found an internal
cylindrical nucleus of pure chalk, much harder than the ordinary
surrounding chalk, and not crumbling to pieces like it, when
exposed to the winter&rsquo;s frost. At the distance of half a
mile, the vertical piles of pot-stones were much farther apart from
each other. Dr. Buckland has described very similar phenomena as
characterising the white chalk on the north coast of Antrim, in
Ireland.*</p>

which grow in the seas of Sumatra; and if we could suppose a series
of such gigantic sponges to be separated from each other, like
trees in a forest, and the individuals of each successive
generation to grow on the exact spot where the parent sponge died
and was enveloped in calcareous mud, so that they should become
piled one above the other in a vertical column, their growth
keeping pace with the accumulation of the enveloping calcareous
mud, a counterpart of the phenomena of the Horstead pot-stones
might be obtained.</p>

<p>Professor Wyville Thomson, describing the modern soundings in
1869 off the north coast of Scotland, speaks of the ooze or chalk
mud brought from a depth of about 3000 feet, and states that at one
haul they obtained forty specimens of vitreous sponges buried in
the mud. He suggests that the Ventriculites of the chalk were
nearly allied to these sponges, and that when the silica of their
spicules was removed, and was dissolved out of the calcareous
matrix, it set into flint.</p>

<p><b>Boulders and Groups of Pebbles in Chalk.</b>&mdash;The
occurrence here and there, in the white chalk of the south of
England, of isolated pebbles of quartz and green schist has justly
excited much wonder. It was at first supposed that they had been
dropped from the roots of some floating tree, by which means stones
are carried to some of the small coral islands of the Pacific. But
the discovery in 1857 of a group of stones in the white chalk near
Croydon, the largest of which was syenite and weighed about forty
pounds, accompanied by pebbles and fine sand like that of a beach,
has been shown by Mr. Godwin Austen to be inexplicable except by
the agency of floating ice. If we consider that icebergs now reach
40 degrees north latitude in the Atlantic, and several degrees
nearer the equator in the southern hemisphere, we can the more
easily believe that even during the Cretaceous epoch, assuming that
the climate was milder, fragments of coast ice may have floated
occasionally as far as the south of England.</p>

<p><b>Distinctness of Mineral Character in Contemporaneous Rocks of
the Cretaceous Period.</b>&mdash;But we must not imagine that
because pebbles are so rare in the white chalk of England and
France there are no proofs of sand, shingle, and clay having</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 293">[ 293 ]</a></p>

<p>been accumulated contemporaneously even in European seas. The
siliceous sandstone called &ldquo;upper quader&rdquo; by the
Germans overlies white argillaceous chalk or
&ldquo;pl&auml;ner-kalk,&rdquo; a deposit resembling in composition
and organic remains the chalk marl of the English series. This
sandstone contains as many fossil shells common to our white chalk
as could be expected in a sea-bottom formed of such different
materials. It sometimes attains a thickness of 600 feet, and, by
its jointed structure and vertical precipices, plays a conspicuous
part in the picturesque scenery of Saxon Switzerland, near Dresden.
It demonstrates that in the Cretaceous sea, as in our own, distinct
mineral deposits were simultaneously in progress. The quartzose
sandstone alluded to, derived from the detritus of the neighbouring
granite, is absolutely devoid of carbonate of lime, yet it was
formed at the distance only of four hundred miles from a sea-bottom
now constituting part of France, where the purely calcareous white
chalk was forming. In the North American continent, on the other
hand, where the Upper Cretaceous formations are so widely
developed, true white chalk, in the ordinary sense of that term,
does not exist.</p>

<p><b>Fossils of the White Chalk.</b>&mdash;Among the fossils of
the white chalk, echinoderms are very numerous; and some of the
genera, like <i>Ananchytes</i> (see Fig. 239), are exclusively
cretaceous. Among the Crinoidea, the <i>Marsupites</i> (<a href=
"images2/fig240.jpg">Fig. 242</a>) is a characteristic genus. Among
the mollusca, the cephalopoda are represented by Ammonites,
Baculites (<a href="images2/fig229.jpg">Fig. 229</a>), and
Belemnites (<a href="images2/fig226.jpg">Fig. 226</a>). Although
there are eight or more species of Ammonites and six of them
peculiar to it, this genus is much less fully represented than in
each of the other subdivisions of the Upper Cretaceous group.</p>

<p>Among the brachiopoda in the white chalk, the <i>
Terebratul&aelig;</i> are very abundant (see <a href=

extinct genus <i>Inoceramus</i> (<i>Catillus</i> of Lam.; see <a

The general absence of univalve mollusca in the white chalk is very
marked. Of bryozoa there is an abundance, such as <i>Eschara</i>
and <i>Escharina</i> (<a href="images2/fig257.jpg">Figs. 257,

indifferently through the soft chalk and hard flint, and some of
the flinty nodules owe their irregular forms to inclosed sponges,
such as Fig. 259, <i>a,</i> where the hollows in the exterior are
caused by the branches of a sponge (Fig. 259, <i>b</i>), seen on
breaking open the flint.</p>

<p>The remains of fishes of the Upper Cretaceous formations consist
chiefly of teeth belonging to the shark family. Some of the genera
are common to the Tertiary formations, and some are distinct. To
the latter belongs the genus <i>Ptychodus</i> (<a href=
"images2/fig260.jpg">Fig. 260</a>), which is allied to the living
Port Jackson shark, <i>Cestracion Phillippi,</i> the anterior teeth
of which (see <a href="images2/fig261.jpg">Fig. 261,</a> <i>a</i>)
are sharp and cutting, while the posterior or palatal teeth
(<i>b</i>) are flat (<a href="images2/fig260.jpg">Fig. 260</a>).
But we meet with no bones of land-animals, nor any terrestrial or
fluviatile shells, nor any plants, except sea-weeds, and here and
there a piece of drift-wood. All the appearances concur</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 297">[ 297 ]</a></p>

<p>in leading us to conclude that the white chalk was the product
of an open sea of considerable depth.</p>

<p>The existence of turtles and oviparous saurians, and of a
Pterodactyl or winged lizard, found in the white chalk of
Maidstone, implies, no doubt, some neighbouring land; but a few
small islets in mid-ocean, like Ascension, formerly so much
frequented by migratory droves of turtle, might perhaps have
afforded the required retreat where these creatures laid their eggs
in the sand, or from which the flying species may have been blown
out to sea. Of the vegetation of such islands we have scarcely any
indication, but it consisted partly of cycadaceous plants; for a
fragment of one of these was found by Captain Ibbetson in the Chalk
Marl of the Isle of Wight, and is referred by A. Brongniart to <i>
Clathraria Lyellii,</i> Mantell, a species common to the antecedent
Wealden period. The fossil plants, however, of beds corresponding
in age to the white chalk at Aix-la-Chapelle, presently to be
described, like the sandy beds of Saxony, before alluded to (<a
href="#page 293">p. 293</a>), afford such evidence of land as to
prove how vague must be any efforts of ours to restore the
geography of that period.</p>

"Fig. 261: Cestracion Phillipi; recent." align="right"> 

<p>The Pterodactyl of the Kentish chalk, above alluded to, was of
gigantic dimensions, measuring 16 feet 6 inches from tip to tip of
its outstretched wings. Some of its elongated bones were at first
mistaken by able anatomists for those of birds; of which class no
osseous remains have as yet been derived from the white chalk,
although they have been found (as will be seen on page 299) in the
Chloritic sand.</p>

puzzled by meeting with certain bodies which they call larch-cones,
which were afterwards recognised by Dr. Buckland</p>

</center>

<p><b>Lower White Chalk.</b>&mdash;The Lower White Chalk, which is
several hundred feet thick, without flints, has yielded 25 species
of Ammonites, of which half are peculiar to it. The genera
Baculite, Hamite, Scaphite, Turrilite, Nautilus, Belemnite, and
Belemnitella, are also represented.</p>

<p><b>Chalk Marl.</b>&mdash;The lower chalk without flints passes
gradually downward, in the south of England, into an argillaceous
limestone, &ldquo;the chalk marl,&rdquo; already alluded to. It
contains 32 species of Ammonites, seven of which are peculiar to
it, while eleven pass up into the overlying lower white chalk. <i>
A. Rhotomagensis</i> is characteristic of this formation. Among the
British cephalopods of other genera may be mentioned <i>Scaphites
&aelig;qualis</i> (<a href="images2/fig265.jpg">Fig. 266</a>) and
<i>Turrilites costatus</i> (<a href="images2/fig265.jpg">Fig.
265</a>).</p>

<p><b>Chloritic Series (or Upper Greensand).</b>&mdash;According to
the old nomenclature, this subdivision of the chalk was called
Upper Greensand, in order to distinguish it from those members of
the Neocomian or Lower Cretaceous series below the Gault to which
the name of Greensand had been applied. Besides the reasons before
given (<a href="#page 282">p. 282</a>) for abandoning this
nomenclature, it is objectionable in this instance as leading the
uninitiated to suppose that the divisions thus named Upper and
Lower Greensand are of co-ordinate value, instead of which the
chloritic sand is quite a subordinate member of the Upper
Cretaceous group, and the term Greensand has very commonly been
used for the whole of the Lower Cretaceous rocks, which are almost
comparable in importance to</p>

 align="right"> 

<p>the entire Upper Cretaceous series. The higher portion of the
Chloritic series in some districts has been called chloritic marl,
from its consisting of a chalky marl with chloritic grains. In
parts of Surrey, where calcareous matter is largely intermixed with
sand, it forms a stone called malm-rock or firestone. In the cliffs
of the southern coast of the Isle of Wight it contains bands of
calcareous limestone with nodules of chert.</p>

<p><i>Coprolite Bed.</i>&mdash;The so-called coprolite bed, found
near Farnham, in Surrey, and near Cambridge, contains nodules of
phosphate of lime in such abundance as to be largely worked for the
manufacture of artificial manure. It belongs to the upper part of
the Chloritic series, and is doubtless chiefly of animal origin,
and may perhaps be partly coprolitic, derived from the excrement of
fish and reptiles. The late Mr. Barrett discovered in it, near
Cambridge, in 1858, the remains of a bird, which was rather larger
than the common pigeon, and probably of the order Natatores, and
which, like most of the Gull tribe, had well-developed wings.
Portions of the metacarpus, metatarsus, tibia, and femur have been
detected, and the determinations of Mr. Barrett have been confirmed
by Professor Owen.</p>

<p>This phosphatic bed in the suburbs of Cambridge must have been
formed partly by the denudation of pre-existing rocks, mostly of
Cretaceous age. The fossil shells and bones of animals washed out
of these denuded strata, now forming a layer only a few feet thick,
have yielded a rich harvest to the collector. A large Rudist of the
genus Radiolite, no less than two feet in height, may be seen in
the Cambridge Museum, obtained from this bed. The number of
reptilian remains, all apparently of Cretaceous age, is truly
surprising; more than ten species of Pterodactyl, five or six of
Ichthyosaurus, one of Pliosaurus, one of Dinosaurus, eight of
Chelonians, besides other forms, having been recognised.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 300">[ 300 ]</a></p>

<p>The chloritic sand is regarded by many geologists as a littoral
deposit of the Chalk Ocean, and therefore contemporaneous with part
of the chalk marl, and even, perhaps, with some part of the white
chalk. For, as the land went on sinking, and the cretaceous sea
widened its area, white mud and chloritic sand were always forming
somewhere, but the line of sea-shore was perpetually shifting its
position. Hence, though both sand and mud originated
simultaneously, the one near the land, the other far from it, the
sands in every locality where a shore became submerged might
constitute the underlying deposit.</p>

</center>

<p>Among the characteristic mollusca of the chloritic sand may be
mentioned <i>Terebrirostra lyra</i> (Fig. 269), <i>Plagiostoma
Hoperi</i> (Fig. 271), <i>Pecten quinque-costatus</i> (Fig. 270),

<p>usually about 100 feet thick in the S.E. of England, is
provincially termed Gault. It consists of a dark blue marl,
sometimes intermixed with green sand. Many peculiar forms of
cephalopoda, such as the <i>Hamite</i> (Fig. 272), and <i>
Scaphite,</i> with other fossils, characterise this formation,
which, small as is its thickness, can be traced by its organic
remains to distant parts of Europe, as, for example, to the
Alps.</p>

<p>Twenty-one species of British Ammonites are recorded as found in
the Gault, of which only eight are peculiar to it, ten being common
to the overlying Chloritic series.</p>

<p><b>Connection between Upper and Lower Cretaceous
Strata.&mdash;Blackdown Beds.</b>&mdash;The break between the Upper
and Lower Cretaceous formations will be appreciated when it is
stated that, although the Neocomian contains 31 species of
Ammonite, and the Gault, as we have seen, 21, there are only three
of those common to both divisions. Nevertheless, we may expect the
discovery in England, and still more when we extend our survey to
the Continent, of beds of passage intermediate between the Upper
and Lower Cretaceous. Even now the Blackdown beds in Devonshire,
which rest immediately on Triassic strata, and which evidently
belong to some part of the Cretaceous series, have been referred by
some geologists to the Upper group, by others to the Lower or
Neocomian. They resemble the Folkestone beds of the latter series
in mineral character, and 59 out of 156 of their fossil mollusca
are common to them; but they have also 16 species common to the
Gault, and 20 to the overlying Chloritic series; and what is very
important, out of seven Ammonites six are found also in the Gault
and Chloritic series, only one being peculiar to the Blackdown
beds.</p>

<p>Professor Ramsay has remarked that there is a stratigraphical
break; for in Kent, Surrey, and Sussex, at those few points where
there are exposures of junctions of the Gault and Neocomian, the
surface of the latter has been much eroded or denuded, while to the
westward of the great chalk escarpment the unconformability of the
two groups is equally striking. At Blackdown this unconformability
is still more marked, for though distant only 100 miles from</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 302">[ 302 ]</a></p>

<p>Kent and Surrey, no formation intervenes between these beds and
the Trias; all intermediate groups, such as the Lower Neocomian and
Oolite, having either not been deposited or destroyed by
denudation.</p>

<p><b>Flora of the Upper Cretaceous Period.</b>&mdash;As the Upper
Cretaceous rocks of Europe are, for the most part, of purely marine
origin, and formed in deep water usually far from the nearest
shore, land-plants of this period, as we might naturally have
anticipated, are very rarely met with. In the neighbourhood of
Aix-la-Chapelle, however, an important exception occurs, for there
certain white sands and laminated clays, 400 feet in thickness,
contain the remains of terrestrial plants in a beautiful state of
preservation. These beds are the equivalents of the white chalk and
chalk marl of England, or Senonien of d&rsquo;Orbigny, although the
white siliceous sands of the lower beds, and the green grains in
the upper part of the formation, cause it to differ in mineral
character from our white chalk.</p>

<p>Beds of fine clay, with fossil plants, and with seams of
lignite, and even perfect coal, are intercalated. Floating wood,
containing perforating shells, such as Pholas and Gastrochoena,
occur. There are likewise a few beds of a yellowish-brown
limestone, with marine shells, which enable us to prove that the
lowest and highest plant-beds belong to one group. Among these
shells are <i>Pecten quadricostatus,</i> and several others which
are common to the upper and lower part of the series, and <i>
Trigonia limbata,</i> D&rsquo;Orbigny, a shell of the white chalk.
On the whole, the organic remains and the geological position of
the strata prove distinctly that in the neighbourhood of
Aix-la-Chapelle a gulf of the ancient Cretaceous sea was bounded by
land composed of Devonian rocks. These rocks consisted of quartzose
and schistose beds, the first of which supplied white sand and the
other argillaceous mud to a river which entered the sea at this
point, carrying down in its turbid waters much drift-wood and the
leaves of plants. Occasionally, when the force of the river abated,
marine shells of the genera <i>Trigonia, Turritella, Pecten,</i>
etc., established themselves in the same area, and plants allied to
<i>Zostera</i> and <i>Fucus</i> grew on the bottom.</p>

<p>The fossil plants of this member of the upper chalk at Aix have
been diligently collected and studied by Dr. Debey, and as they
afford the only example yet known of a terrestrial flora older than
the Eocene, in which the great divisions of the vegetable kingdom
are represented in nearly the same proportions as in our own times,
they deserve particular attention. Dr. Debey estimates the number
of species</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 303">[ 303 ]</a></p>

<p>as amounting to more than two hundred, of which sixty-seven are
cryptogamous, chiefly ferns, twenty species of which can be well
determined, most of them being in fructification. The scars on the
bark of one or two are supposed to indicate tree-ferns. Of thirteen
genera three are still existing, namely, <i>Gleichenia,</i> now
inhabiting the Cape of Good Hope, and New Holland; Lygodium, now
spread extensively through tropical regions, but having some
species which live in Japan and North America; and <i>
Asplenium,</i> a cosmopolite form. Among the ph&aelig;nogamous
plants, the Conifers are abundant, the most common belonging to a
genus called Cycadopteris by Debey, and hardly separable from
Sequoia (or Wellingtonia), of which both the cones and branches are
preserved. When I visited Aix, I found the silicified wood of this
plant very plentifully dispersed through the white sands in the
pits near that city. In one silicified trunk 200 rings of annual
growth could be counted. Species of Araucaria like those of
Australia are also found. Cycads are extremely rare, and of
Monocotyledons there are but few. No palms have been recognised
with certainty, but the genus Pandanus, or screw pine, has been
distinctly made out. The number of the Dicotyledonous Angiosperms
is the most striking feature in so ancient a flora.*</p>

<p>Among them we find the familiar forms of the Oak, Fig, and
Walnut (Quercus, Ficus, and Juglans), of the last both the nuts and
leaves; also several genera of the Myrtace&aelig;. But the
predominant order is the Proteace&aelig;, of which there are
between sixty and seventy supposed species, many of extinct genera,
but some referred to the following living forms&mdash;Dryandra,
Grevillea, Hakea, Banksia, Persoonia&mdash;all</p>

<p class="fnote">* In this and subsequent remarks on fossil plants
I shall often use Dr. Lindley&rsquo;s terms, as most familiar in
this country; but as those of M. A. Brongniart are much cited, it
may be useful to geologists to give a table explaining the
corresponding names of groups so much spoken of in
pal&aelig;ontology.</p>

<p>now belonging to Australia, and Leucospermum, species of which
form small bushes at the Cape.</p>

<p>The epidermis of the leaves of many of these Aix plants,
especially of the Proteace&aelig;, is so perfectly preserved in an
envelope of fine clay, that under the microscope the stomata, or
polygonal cellules, can be detected, and their peculiar arrangement
is identical with that known to characterise some living
Proteace&aelig; (Grevillea, for example). Although this peculiarity
of the structure of stomata is also found in plants of widely
distant orders, it is, on the whole, but rarely met with, and being
thus observed to characterise a foliage previously suspected to be
proteaceous, it adds to the probability that the botanical evidence
had been correctly interpreted.</p>

<p>An occasional admixture at Aix-la-Chapelle of Fucoids and
Zosterites attests, like the shells, the presence of salt-water. Of
insects, Dr. Debey has obtained about ten species of the families
Curculionid&aelig; and Carabid&aelig;.</p>

<p>The resemblance of the flora of Aix-la-Chapelle to the tertiary
and living floras in the proportional number of dicotyledonous
angiosperms as compared to the gymnogens, is a subject of no small
theoretical interest, because we can now affirm that these Aix
plants flourished before the rich reptilian fauna of the secondary
rocks had ceased to exist. The Ichthyosaurus, Pterodactyl, and
Mosasaurus were of coeval date with the oak, the walnut, and the
fig. Speculations have often been hazarded respecting a connection
between the rarity of Exogens in the older rocks and a peculiar
state of the atmosphere. A denser air, it was suggested, had in
earlier times been alike adverse to the well-being of the higher
order of flowering plants, and of the quick-breathing animals, such
as mammalia and birds, while it was favourable to a cryptogamic and
gymnospermous flora, and to a predominance of reptile life. But we
now learn that there is no incompatibility in the co-existence of a
vegetation like that of the present globe, and some of the most
remarkable forms of the extinct reptiles of the age of
gymnosperms.</p>

<p>If the passage seem at present to be somewhat sudden from the
flora of the Lower or Neocomian to that of the Upper Cretaceous
period, the abruptness of the change will probably disappear when
we are better acquainted with the fossil vegetation of the
uppermost beds of the Neocomian and that of the lowest strata of
the Gault or true Cretaceous series.</p>

<p>superposition, mineral character, and fossils, the geologist has
been enabled to refer to the same Cretaceous period certain rocks
in the north and south of Europe, which differ greatly both in
their fossil contents and in their mineral composition and
structure.</p>

<p>If we attempt to trace the cretaceous deposits from England and
France to the countries bordering the Mediterranean, we perceive,
in the first place, that in the neighbourhood of London and Paris
they form one great continuous mass, the Straits of Dover being a
trifling interruption, a mere valley with chalk cliffs on both
sides. We then observe that the main body of the chalk which
surrounds Paris stretches from Tours to near Poitiers (see Fig.
273, in which the shaded part represents chalk).</p>

<p>Between Poitiers and La Rochelle, the space marked A on the map
separates two regions of chalk. This space is occupied by the
Oolite and certain other formations older than the Chalk and
Neocomian, and has been supposed by M. E. de Beaumont to have
formed an island in the Cretaceous sea. South of this space we
again meet with rocks which we at once recognise to be cretaceous,
partly from the chalky matrix and partly from the fossils being
very similar to those of the white chalk of the north: especially
certain species of the genera <i>Spatangus, Ananchytes, Cidarites,
Nucula, Ostrea,</i></p>

Trigonia, Catillus (Inoceramus),</i> and <i>Terebratula.</i>* But
Ammonites, as M. d&rsquo;Archiac observes, of which so many species
are met with in the chalk of the north of France, are scarcely ever
found in the southern region; while the genera <i>Hamite,
Turrilite,</i> and <i>Scaphite,</i> and perhaps <i>Belemnite,</i>
are entirely wanting.</p>

<p>On the other hand, certain forms are common in the south which
are rare or wholly unknown in the north of France. Among these may
be mentioned many <i>Hippurites, Sph&aelig;rulites,</i> and other
members of that great family of mollusca called <i>Rudistes</i> by
Lamarck, to which nothing analogous has been discovered in the
living creation, but which is quite characteristic of rocks of the
Cretaceous era in the south of France, Spain, Sicily, Greece, and
other countries bordering the Mediterranean. The species called <i>
Hippurites organisans</i> (Fig. 276) is more abundant than any
other in the south of Europe; and the geologist should make himself
well acquainted with the cast of the interior, <i>d,</i> which is
often the only part preserved in many compact marbles of the Upper
Cretaceous period. The flutings on the interior of the Hippurite,
which are represented on the cast by smooth, rounded longitudinal
ribs, and in some individuals attain a great size and length, are
wholly unlike the markings on the exterior of the shell.</p>

<p><b>Cretaceous Rocks in the United States.</b>&mdash;If we pass
to the American continent, we find in the State of New Jersey a
series of sandy and argillaceous beds wholly unlike in mineral
character to our Upper Cretaceous system; which we can,
nevertheless, recognise as referable, pal&aelig;ontologically, to
the same division.</p>

<p>That they were about the same age generally as the European
chalk and Neocomian, was the conclusion to which Dr. Morton and Mr.
Conrad came after their investigation of the fossils in 1834. The
strata consist chiefly of green sand and green marl, with an
overlying coralline limestone of a pale yellow colour, and the
fossils, on the whole, agree most nearly with those of the Upper
European series, from the Maestricht beds to the Gault inclusive. I
collected sixty shells from the New Jersey deposits in 1841, five
of which were identical with European species&mdash;<i>Ostrea larva, O.
vesicularis, Gryph&aelig;a costata, Pecten quinque-costatus,
Belemnitella mucronata.</i> As some of these have the greatest
vertical range in Europe, they might be expected more than any
others to recur in distant parts of the globe. Even where the
species were different, the generic forms, such as the Baculite and
certain sections of Ammonites, as also the <i>Inoceramus</i> (see
<a href="images2/fig251.jpg">Fig. 252</a>) and other bivalves, have
a decidedly cretaceous aspect. Fifteen out of the sixty shells
above alluded to were regarded by Professor Forbes as good
geographical representatives of well-known cretaceous fossils of
Europe. The correspondence, therefore, is not small, when we
reflect that the part of the United States where these strata occur
is between 3000 and 4000 miles distant from the chalk of Central
and Northern Europe, and that there is a difference of ten degrees
in the latitude of the places compared on opposite sides of the
Atlantic. Fish of the genera <i>Lamna, Galeus,</i> and <i>
Carcharodon</i> are common to New Jersey and the European
cretaceous rocks. So also is the genus <i>Mosasaurus</i> among
reptiles.</p>

<p>It appears from the labours of Dr. Newberry and others, that the
Cretaceous strata of the United States east and west of the
Appalachians are characterised by a flora decidedly analogous to
that of Aix-la-Chapelle above-mentioned, and therefore having
considerable resemblance to the vegetation of the Tertiary and
Recent Periods.</p>
