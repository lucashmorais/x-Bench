<p><b>Upper Miocene Strata of France&mdash;Faluns of
Touraine.</b>&mdash;The strata which we meet with next in the
descending order are those called by many geologists &ldquo;Middle
Tertiary,&rdquo; for which in 1833 I proposed the name of Miocene,
selecting the &ldquo;faluns&rdquo; of the valley of the Loire, in
France, as my example or type. I shall now call these falunian
deposits Upper Miocene, to distinguish them from others to which
the name of Lower Miocene will be given.</p>

<p>No British strata have a distinct claim to be regarded as Upper
Miocene, and as the Lower Miocene are also but feebly represented
in the British Isles, we must refer to foreign examples in
illustration of this important period in the earth&rsquo;s history.
The term &ldquo;faluns&rdquo; is given provincially by French
agriculturists to shelly sand and marl spread over the land in
Touraine, just as similar shelly deposits were formerly much used
in Suffolk to fertilise the soil, before the coprolitic or
phosphatic nodules came into use. Isolated masses of such faluns
occur from near the mouth of the Loire, in the neighbourhood of
Nantes, to as far inland as a district south of Tours. They are
also found at Pontlevoy, on the Cher, about seventy miles above the
junction of that river with the Loire, and thirty miles south-east
of Tours. Deposits of the same age also appear under new mineral
conditions near the towns of Dinan and Rennes, in Brittany. I have
visited all the localities above enumerated, and found the beds on
the Loire to consist principally of sand and marl, in which are
shells and corals, some entire, some rolled, and others in minute
fragments. In certain districts, as at Dou&eacute;, in the
Department of Maine and Loire, ten miles south-west</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 212">[ 212 ]</a></p>

<p>of Saumur, they form a soft building-stone, chiefly composed of
an aggregate of broken shells, bryozoa, corals, and echinoderms,
united by a calcareous cement; the whole mass being very like the
Coralline Crag near Aldborough, and Sudbourn in Suffolk. The
scattered patches of faluns are of slight thickness, rarely
exceeding fifty feet; and between the district called Sologne and
the sea they repose on a great variety of older rocks; being seen
to rest successively upon gneiss, clay-slate, various secondary
formations, including the chalk; and, lastly, upon the upper
fresh-water limestone of the Parisian tertiary series, which, as
before mentioned <a href="ch9.html#page 142">(p. 142)</a>,
stretches continuously from the basin of the Seine to that of the
Loire.</p>

<img src="images1/fig136.jpg" width="170" height="235" alt=
"Fig. 136: Dinotherium giganteum." align="left"> 

<p>At some points, as at Louans, south of Tours, the shells are
stained of a ferruginous colour, not unlike that of the Red Crag of
Suffolk. The species are, for the most part, marine, but a few of
them belong to land and fluviatile genera. Among the former, <i>
Helix turonensis)</i> (<a href="images/fig38.jpg">Fig. 38</a>) is
the most abundant. Remains of terrestrial quadrupeds are here and
there intermixed, belonging to the genera Dinotherium (Fig. 136),
Mastodon, Rhinoceros, Hippopotamus, Ch&aelig;ropotamus, Dichobune,
Deer, and others, and these are accompanied by cetacea, such as the
Lamantin, Morse, Sea-calf, and Dolphin, all of extinct species.</p>

<p>The fossil testacea of the faluns of the Loire imply, according
to the late Edward Forbes, that the beds were formed partly on the
shore itself at the level of low water, and partly at very moderate
depths, not exceeding ten fathoms below that level. The molluscan
fauna is, on the whole, much more littoral than that of the
Pliocene Red and Coralline Crag of Suffolk, and implies a shallower
sea. It is, moreover, contrasted with the Suffolk Crag by the
indications it affords of an extra-European climate. Thus it
contains seven species of Cypr&aelig;a, some larger than any
existing cowry of the Mediterranean, several species of <i>Oliva,
Ancillaria, Mitra, Terebra, Pyrula, Fasciolaria,</i> and <i>
Conus.</i> Of the cones there are no less than eight species, some
very large, whereas the only European cone now living is of
diminutive size. The genus <i>Nerita,</i> and many others, are also
represented by individuals</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 213">[ 213 ]</a></p>

<p>of a type now characteristic of equatorial seas, and wholly
unlike any Mediterranean forms. These proofs of a more elevated
temperature seem to imply the higher antiquity of the faluns as
compared with the Suffolk Crag, and are in perfect accordance with
the fact of the smaller proportion of testacea of recent species
found in the faluns.</p>

<p>Out of 290 species of shells, collected by myself in 1840 at
Pontlevoy, Louans, Boss&eacute;e, and other villages twenty miles
south of Tours, and at Savign&eacute;, about fifteen miles
north-west of that place, seventy-two only could be identified with
recent species, which is in the proportion of twenty-five per cent.
A large number of the 290 species are common to all the localities,
those peculiar to each not being more numerous than we might expect
to find in different bays of the same sea.</p>

<p>The total number of species of testaceous mollusca from the
faluns in my possession is 302, of which forty-five only, or
fourteen per cent, were found by Mr. Wood to be common to the
Suffolk Crag. The number of corals, including bryozoa and
zoantharia, obtained by me at Dou&eacute; and other localities
before adverted to, amounts to forty-three, as determined by Mr.
Lonsdale, of which seven (one of them a zoantharian) agree
specifically with those of the Suffolk Crag. Some of the genera
occurring fossil in Touraine, as the corals Astrea and <i>
Dendrophyllia</i>, and the bryozoan <i>Lunulites</i>, have not been
found in European seas north of the Mediterranean; nevertheless,
the zoantharia of the faluns do not seem to indicate, on the whole,
so warm a climate as would be inferred from the shells.</p>

<p>It was stated that, on comparing about 300 species of Touraine
shells with about 450 from the Suffolk Crag, forty-five only were
found to be common to both, which is in the proportion of only
fifteen per cent. The same small amount of agreement is found in
the corals also. I formerly endeavoured to reconcile this marked
difference in species with the supposed co-existence of the two
faunas, by imagining them to have severally belonged to distinct
zoological provinces or two seas, the one opening to the north and
the other to the south, with a barrier of land between them, like
the Isthmus of Suez, now separating the Red Sea and the
Mediterranean. But I now abandon that idea for several reasons;
among others, because I succeeded in 1841 in tracing the Crag fauna
southward in Normandy to within seventy miles of the Falunian type,
near Dinan, yet found that both assemblages of fossils retained
their distinctive characters, showing no signs of any blending of
species or transition of climate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 214">[ 214 ]</a></p>

<p>The principal grounds, however, for referring the English Crag
to the older Pliocene and the French faluns to the Upper Miocene
epochs, consist in the predominance of fossil shells in the British
strata identifiable with species not only still living, but which
are now inhabitants of neighbouring seas, while the accompanying
extinct species are of genera such as characterise Europe. In the
faluns, on the contrary, the recent species are in a decided
minority; and most of them are now inhabitants of the
Mediterranean, the coast of Africa, and the Indian Ocean; in a
word, less northern in character, and pointing to the prevalence of
a warmer climate. They indicate a state of things receding farther
from the present condition of Central Europe in physical geography
and climate, and doubtless, therefore, receding farther from our
era in time.</p>

<img src="images1/fig137.jpg" width="134" height="300" alt=
"Fig. 137: Voluta Lamberti." align="left"> 

<p>Among the conspicuous fossils common to the faluns of the Loire
and the Suffolk Crag is a variety of the <i>Voluta Lamberti</i>, a
shell already alluded to <a href="images1/fig123.jpg">(Fig.
123).</a> The specimens of this shell which I have myself collected
in Touraine, or have seen in museums, are thicker and heavier than
British individuals of the same species, and shorter in proportion
to their width, and have the folds on the columella less oblique,
as represented in Fig. 137.</p>

<p><b>Upper Miocene of Bordeaux and the South of
France.</b>&mdash;A great extent of country between the Pyrenees
and the Gironde is overspread by tertiary deposits of various ages,
and chiefly of Miocene date. Some of these, near Bordeaux, coincide
in age with the faluns of Touraine, already mentioned, but many of
the species of shells are peculiar to the south. The succession of
beds in the basin of the Gironde implies several oscillations of
level by which the same wide area was alternately converted into
sea and land and into brackish-water lagoons, and finally into
fresh-water ponds and lakes.</p>

<p>Among the fresh-water strata of this age near the base of the
Pyrenees are marls, limestones and sands, in which the eminent
comparative anatomist, M. Lartet, has obtained a great number of
fossil mammalia common to the faluns of the Loire and the Upper
Miocene beds of Switzerland, such as <i>Dinotherium giganteum</i>
and <i>Mastodon angustidens</i>; also</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 215">[ 215 ]</a></p>

<p>the bones of quadrumana, or of the ape and monkey tribe, which
were discovered in 1837, the first of that order of quadrupeds
detected in Europe. They were found near Auch, in the Department of
Gers, in latitude 43&deg; 39' N. About forty miles west of
Toulouse. They were referred by MM. Lartet and Blainville to a
genus closely allied to the Gibbon, to which they gave the name of
<i>Pliopithecus.</i> Subsequently, in 1856, M. Lartet described
another species of the same family of long-armed apes
(<i>Hylobates</i>), which he obtained from strata of the same age
at Saint-Gaudens, in the Haute Garonne. The fossil remains of this
animal consisted of a portion of a lower jaw with teeth and the
shaft of a humerus. It is supposed to have been a tree-climbing
frugivorous ape, equalling man in stature. As the trunks of oaks
are common in the lignite beds in which it lay, it has received the
generic name of <i>Dryopithecus.</i> The angle formed by the
ascending ramus of the jaw and the alveolar border is less open,
and therefore more like the human subject, than in the Chimpanzee,
and what is still more remarkable, the fossil, a young but adult
individual, had all its milk teeth replaced by the second set,
while its last true molar (or wisdom-tooth) was still undeveloped,
or only existed as a germ in the jaw-bone. In the mode, therefore,
of the succession of its teeth (which, as in all the old-World
apes, exactly agree in number with those in man) it differed from
the Gorilla and Chimpanzee, and corresponded with the human
species.</p>

<p><b>Upper Miocene Beds of &OElig;ningen, in
Switzerland.</b>&mdash;The faluns of the Loire first served, as
already stated (p. 211), as the type of the Miocene formations in
Europe. They yielded a plentiful harvest of marine fossil shells
and corals, but were entirely barren of plants and insects. In
Switzerland, on the other hand, deposits of the same age have been
discovered, remarkable for their botanical and entomological
treasures. We are indebted to Professor Heer, of Zurich, for the
description, restoration, and classification of several hundred
species and varieties of these fossil plants, the whole of which he
has illustrated by excellent figures in his &ldquo;Flora Tertiaria
Helveti&aelig;.&rdquo; This great work, and those of Adolphe
Brongniart, Unger, Goppert and others, show that this class of
fossils is beginning to play the same important part in the
classification of the tertiary strata containing lignite or brown
coal as an older flora has long played in enabling us to understand
the ancient coal or carboniferous formation. No small skepticism
has always prevailed among botanists as to whether the leaves alone
and the wood of plants could</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 216">[ 216 ]</a></p>

<p>ever afford sufficient data for determining even genera and
families in the vegetable kingdom. In truth, before such remains
could be rendered available a new science had to be created. It was
necessary to study the outlines, nervation, and microscopic
structure of the leaves, with a degree of care which had never been
called for in the classification of living plants, where the flower
and fruit afforded characters so much more definite and
satisfactory. As geologists, we can not be too grateful to those
who, instead of despairing when so difficult a task was presented
to them, or being discouraged when men of the highest scientific
attainments treated the fossil leaves as worthless, entered with
full faith and enthusiasm into this new and unexplored field. That
they should frequently have fallen into errors was unavoidable, but
it is remarkable, especially if we inquire into the history of
Professor Heer&rsquo;s researches, how often early conjectures as
to the genus and family founded on the leaves alone were afterwards
confirmed when fuller information was obtained. As examples to be
found on comparing Heer&rsquo;s earlier and later works, I may
instance the chestnut, elm, maple, cinnamon, magnolia, buckbean or
Menyanthes, vine, buckthorn (<i>Rhamnus</i>), <i>Andromeda</i> and
<i>Myrica,</i> and among the conifers <i>Sequoia</i> and <i>
Taxodium.</i> In all these cases the plants were first recognised
by their leaves, and the accuracy of the determination was
afterwards confirmed when the fruit, and in some instances both
fruit and flower, were found attached to the same stem as the
leaves.</p>

<p>But let us suppose that no fruit, seed, or flower had ever been
met with in a fossil state, we should still have been indebted to
the persevering labours of botanical pal&aelig;ontologists for one
of the grandest scientific discoveries for which the present
century is remarkable&mdash;namely, the proofs now established of
the prevalence of a mild climate and a rich arborescent flora in
the arctic regions in that Miocene epoch on the history of which we
are now entering. It may be useful if I endeavour to give the
reader in a few words some idea of the nature of the evidence of
these important conclusions, to show how far they may be safely
based on fossil leaves alone. When we begin by studying the fossils
of the Newer Pliocene deposits, such as those of the Upper Val
d&rsquo;Arno, before alluded to, we perceive that the fossil
foliage agrees almost entirely with the trees and shrubs of a
modern European forest. In the plants of the Older Pliocene strata
of the same region we observe a larger proportion of species and
genera which, although they may agree with well-known Asiatic or
other foreign types, are at present</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 217">[ 217 ]</a></p>

<p>wanting in Italy. If we then examine the Miocene formations of
the same country, exotic forms become more abundant, especially the
palms, whether they belong to the European or American fan-palms,
<i>Cham&aelig;rops</i> and <i>Sabal</i>, or to the more tropical
family of the date-palms or <i>Ph&oelig;nicites</i>, which last are
conspicuous in the Lower Miocene beds of Central Europe. Although
we have not found the fruit or flower of these palms in a fossil
state, the leaves are so characteristic that no one doubts the
family to which they belong, or hesitates to accept them as
indications of a warm and sub-tropical climate.</p>

<p>When the Miocene formations are traced to the northward of the
50th degree of latitude, the fossil palms fail us, but the greater
proportion of the leaves, whether identical with those of existing
European trees or of forms now unknown in Europe, which had
accompanied the Miocene palms, still continue to characterise rocks
of the same age, until we meet with them not only in Iceland, but
in Greenland, in latitude 70&deg; N., and in Spitzbergen, latitude
78&deg; 56', or within about 11 degrees of the pole, and under
circumstances which clearly show them to have been indigenous in
those regions, and not to have been drifted from the south <a href=
"ch15.html#page 240">(see p. 240).</a> Not only, therefore, has the
botanist afforded the geologist much pal&aelig;ontological
assistance in identifying distinct tertiary formations in distant
places by his power of accurately discriminating the forms,
veining, and microscopic structure of leaves or wood, but,
independently of that exact knowledge derivable from the organs of
fructification, we are indebted to him for one of the most novel,
unexpected results of modern scientific inquiry.</p>

<p>The Miocene formations of Switzerland have been called <i>
Molasse</i>, a term derived from the French <i>mol</i>, and applied
to a <i>soft</i>, incoherent, greenish sandstone, occupying the
country between the Alps and the Jura. This molasse comprises three
divisions, of which the middle one is marine, and being closely
related by its shells to the faluns of Touraine, may be classed as
Upper Miocene. The two others are fresh-water, the upper of which
may be also grouped with the faluns, while the lower must be
referred to the Lower Miocene, as defined in the next chapter.</p>

<p><b>Upper Fresh-water Molasse.</b>&mdash;This formation is best
seen at &OElig;ningen, in the valley of the Rhine, between Constance
and Schaffhausen, a locality celebrated for having produced in the
year 1700 the supposed human skeleton called by Scheuchzer
&ldquo;homo diluvii testis,&rdquo; a fossil afterwards demonstrated
by Cuvier to be a reptile, or aquatic salamander,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 218">[ 218 ]</a></p>

<p>of larger dimensions than even its great living representative,
the salamander of Japan.</p>

<p>The &OElig;ningen strata consist of a series of marls and
limestones, many of them thinly laminated, and which appear to have
slowly accumulated in a lake probably fed by springs holding
carbonate of lime in solution. The elliptical area over which this
fresh-water formation has been traced extends, according to Sir
Roderick Murchison, for a distance of ten miles east and west from
Berlingen, on the right bank of the river to Wangen, and to
&OElig;ningen, near Stein, on the left bank. The organic remains
have been chiefly derived from two quarries, the lower of which is
about 550 feet above the level of the Lake of Constance, while the
upper quarry is 150 feet higher. In this last, a section thirty
feet deep displays a great succession of beds, most of them
splitting into slabs and some into very thin lamin&aelig;.
Twenty-one beds are enumerated by Professor Heer, the uppermost a
bluish-grey marl seven feet thick, with organic remains, resting on
a limestone with fossil plants, including leaves of poplar,
cinnamon, and pond-weed (<i>Potamogeton</i>), together with some
insects; while in the bed No. 4, below, is a bituminous rock, in
which the <i>Mastodon tapiroides</i>, a characteristic Upper
Miocene quadruped, has been met with. The 5th bed, two or three
inches thick, contains fossil fish, e.g., <i>Leuciscus</i> (roach),
and the larv&aelig; of dragon-flies, with plants such as the elm
(<i>Ulmus</i>), and the aquatic Chara. Below this are other
plant-beds; and then, in No. 9, the stone in which the great
salamander (Andrias Scheuchzeri) and some fish were found. Below
this other strata occur with fish, tortoises, the great salamander
before alluded to, fresh-water mussels, and plants. In No. 16 the
fossil fox of &OElig;ningen, <i>Galecynus &OElig;ningensis,</i> Owen,
was obtained by Sir R. Murchison. To this succeed other beds with
mammalia (<i>Lagomys</i>), reptiles, (<i>Emys</i>), fish, and
plants, such as walnut, maple, and poplar. In the 19th bed are
numerous fish, insects, and plants, below which are marls of a blue
indigo colour.</p>

<p>In the lower quarry eleven beds are mentioned, in which, as in
the upper, both land and fresh-water plants and many insects occur.
In the 6th, reckoning from the top, many plants have been obtained,
such as <i>Liquidambar, Daphnogene, Podogonium,</i> and <i>
Ulmus</i>, together with tortoises, besides the bones and teeth of
a ruminant quadruped, named by H. von Meyer <i>Pal&aelig;omeryx
eminens.</i> No. 9 is called the insect-bed, a layer only a few
inches thick, which, when exposed to the frost, splits into leaves
as thin as paper. In these thin lamin&aelig; plants such as <i>
Liquidambar, Daphnogene,</i> and <i>Glyptostrobus</i>,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 219">[ 219 ]</a></p>

<p>occur, with innumerable insects in a wonderful state of
preservation, usually found singly. Below this is an indigo-blue
marl, like that at the bottom of the higher quarry, resting on
yellow marl ascertained to be at least thirty feet thick.</p>

<img src="images1/fig138.jpg" width="216" height="299" alt=
"Fig. 138: Cinnamomum polymorphum." align="left"> 

<p>All the above fossil-bearing strata were evidently formed with
extreme slowness. Although the fossiliferous beds are, in the
aggregate, no more than a few yards in thickness, and have only
been examined in the small area comprised in the two quarries just
alluded to, they give us an insight into the state of animal and
vegetable life in part of the Upper Miocene period, such as no
other region in the world has elsewhere supplied. In the year 1859,
Professor Heer had already determined no less than 475 species of
plants and more than 800 insects from these &OElig;ningen beds. He
supposes that a river entering a lake floated into it some of the
leaves and land insects, together with the carcasses of quadrupeds,
among others a great Mastodon. Occasionally, during tempests, twigs
and even boughs of trees with their leaves were torn off and
carried for some distance so as to reach the lake. Springs,
containing carbonate of lime, seem at some points to have supplied
calcareous matter in solution, giving origin locally to a kind of
travertin, in which organic bodies sinking to the bottom became
hermetically sealed up. The lamin&aelig;, says Heer, which
immediately succeed each other were not all formed at the same
season, for it can be shown that, when some of them originated,
certain plants were in flower, whereas, when the next of these
layers was produced, the same plants had ripened their fruit. This
inference is confirmed by independent proofs derived from insects.
The principal insect-bed is rarely two inches thick, and is
composed, says Heer, of about 250 leaf-like lamin&aelig;, some of
which were deposited in the spring, when the <i>Cinnamomum
polymorphum</i> (Fig. 138) was in flower, others in summer, when
winged ants were numerous, and when the poplar and willow had
matured their seed; others, again, in autumn, when the same <i>
Cinnamomum polymorphum</i> (Fig. 138) was in fruit, as well as the
liquidambar, oak, clematis,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 220">[ 220 ]</a></p>

<p>and many other plants. The ancient lake seems to have had a belt
of poplars and willows round its borders, countless leaves of which
were imbedded in mud, and together with them, at some points, a
species of reed, <i>Arundo</i>, which was very common.</p>

<p>One of the most characteristic shrubs is a papilionaceous and
leguminous plant of an extinct genus, called by Heer <i>
Podogonium</i>, of which two species are known. Entire twigs have
been found with flowers, and always without leaves, as the flowers
evidently came out, as in the poplar and willow tribe, before any
leaves made their appearance. Other specimens have been obtained
with ripe fruits accompanied by leaves, which resemble those of the
tamarind, to which it was evidently allied, being of the family
C&aelig;salpine&aelig;, now proper to warmer regions.</p>

<img src="images1/fig139.jpg" width="251" height="337" alt=
"Fig. 138: Acer trilobatum." align="left"> 

<p>The Upper Miocene flora of &OElig;ningen is peculiarly important,
in consequence of the number of genera of which not merely the
leaves, but, as in the case of the <i>Podogonium</i> just
mentioned, the fruit also and even the flower are known. Thus there
are nineteen species of maple, ten of which have already been found
with fruit. Although in no one region of the globe do so many
maples now flourish, we need not suspect Professor Heer of having
made too many species in this genus when we consider the manner in
which he has dealt with one of them, <i>Acer trilobatum</i>, Figs.
139 and 140. Of this plant the number of marked varieties figured
and named is very great, and no less than three of them had been
considered as distinct species by other botanists, while six of the
others might have laid claim, with nearly equal propriety, to a
like distinction. The common form, called <i>Acer trilobatum</i>,
Fig. 139, may be taken as a normal representative of the
&OElig;ningen fossil, and Fig. 140, as one of the most divergent
varieties, having almost four lobes in the leaf instead of
three.</p>

"Fig. 140: Acer trilobatum."></center>

<p>Among the conspicuous genera which abounded in the Miocene
period in Europe is the plane-tree, <i>Platanus,</i> the fossil
species being considered by Heer to come nearer to the American <i>
P. occidentalis</i> than to <i>P. orientalis</i> of Greece and Asia
Minor. In some of the fossil specimens the male flowers are
preserved. Among other points of resemblance with the living
plane-trees, as we see them in the parks and squares of London,
fossil fragments of the trunk are met with, having pieces of their
bark peeling off.</p>

<img src="images1/fig141.jpg" width="166" height="271" alt=

<p>The vine of &OElig;ningen, <i>Vitis teutonica</i>, Ad. Brong, is
of a North American type. Both the leaves and seeds have been found
at &OElig;ningen, and bunches of compressed grapes of the same
species have been met with in the brown coal of Wetteravia in
Germany. No less than eight species of smilax, a monocotyledonous
genus, occur at &OElig;ningen and in other Upper Miocene localities,
the flowers of some of them, as well as the leaves, being
preserved; as in the case of the very common fossil, <i>S.
sagittifera</i>, Fig. 142, <i>a.</i></p>

<p>Leaves of plants supposed to belong to the order Proteace&aelig;
have been obtained partly from &OElig;ningen and partly from the
lacustrine formation of the same age at Locle in the Jura. They
have been referred to the genera <i>Banksia, Grevillea, Hakea,</i>
and <i>Persoonia.</i> Of Hakea there is the impression of a
supposed seed-vessel, with its characteristic thick stalk and
seeds, but as the fruit is without structure, and has not yet</p>

incomplete.</p>

<p>To whatever family the foliage hitherto regarded as proteaceous
by many able pal&aelig;ontologists may eventually be shown to
belong, we must be careful not to question their affinity to that
order of plants on those geographical considerations which have
influenced some botanists. The nearest living Proteace&aelig; now
feel the in Abyssinia in lat. 20&deg; N., but the greatest number
are confined to the Cape and Australia. The ancestors, however, of
the &OElig;ningen fossils ought not to be looked for in such distant
regions, but from that European land which in Lower Miocene times
bore trees with similar foliage, and these had doubtless an Eocene
source, for cones admitted by all botanists to be proteaceous have
been met with in one division of that older Tertiary group <a href=
"images1/fig206.jpg">(see Fig. 206</a>). The source of these last,
again, must not be sought in the antipodes, for in the white chalk
of Aix-la-Chapelle leaves like those of Grevillea and other
proteaceous genera have been found in abundance, and, as we shall
see <a href="ch17.html#page 304">(p. 304)</a> in a most perfect
state of preservation. All geologists agree that the distribution
of the Cretaceous land and sea had scarcely any connection with the
present geography of the globe.</p>

<p>In the same beds with the supposed Proteace&aelig; there occurs
at Locle a fan-palm of the American type Sabal (for genus see Fig.
151), a genus which ranges throughout the low country near the sea
from the Carolinas to Florida and</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 223">[ 223 ]</a></p>

<p>Louisiana. Among the Conifer&aelig; of Upper Miocene age is
found a deciduous cypress nearly allied to the <i>Taxodium
distichum</i> of North America, and a <i>Glyptostrobus</i> (Fig.
144), very like the Japanese <i>G. heterophyllus,</i> now common in
our shrubberies.</p>

<img src="images1/fig144.jpg" width="120" height="214" alt=
"Fig. 144: Glyptostrobus Europ&aelig;us." align="right"> 

<p>Before the appearance of Heer&rsquo;s work on the Miocene Flora
of Switzerland, Unger and Goppert had already pointed out the large
proportion of living North American genera which distinguished the
vegetation of the Miocene period in Central Europe. Next in number,
says Heer, to these American forms at &OElig;ningen the European
genera preponderate, the Asiatic ranking in the third, the African
in the fourth, and the Australian in the fifth degree. The American
forms are more numerous than in the Italian Pliocene flora, and the
whole vegetation indicates a warmer climate than the Pliocene,
though not so high a temperature as that of the older or Lower
Miocene period.</p>

<p>The conclusions drawn from the insects are for the most part in
perfect harmony with those derived from the plants, but they have a
somewhat less tropical and less American aspect, the South European
types being more numerous. On the whole, the insect fauna is richer
than that now inhabiting any part of Europe. No less than 844
species are reckoned by Heer from the &OElig;ningen beds alone, the
number of specimens which he has examined being 5080. The entire
list of Swiss species from the Upper and Lower Miocene together
amount to 1322. Almost all the living families of Coleoptera are
represented, but, as we might have anticipated from the
preponderance of arborescent and ligneous plants, the wood-eating
beetles play the most conspicuous part, the Buprestid&aelig; and
other long-horned beetles being particularly abundant.</p>

<p>The patterns and some remains of the colours both of <i>
Coleoptera</i> and <i>Hemiptera</i> are preserved at &OElig;ningen,
as, for example in <i>Harpactor</i> (Fig. 145), in which the
antenn&aelig;, one of the eyes, and the legs and wings are
retained. The characters, indeed, of many of the insects are so
well defined as to incline us to believe that if this class of the
invertebrata were not so rare and local, they might be more useful
than even the plants and shells in settling chronological points in
geology.</p>

Switzerland.</b>&mdash;It was before stated that the Miocene
formation of Switzerland</p>

<p>consisted of, first, the upper fresh-water molasse, comprising
the lacustrine marls of &OElig;ningen; secondly, the marine molasse,
corresponding in age to the faluns of Touraine; and thirdly, the
lower fresh-water molasse. Some of the beds of the marine or middle
series reach a height of 2470 feet above the sea. A large number of
the shells are common to the faluns of Touraine, the Vienna basin,
and other Upper Miocene localities. The terrestrial plants play a
subordinate part in the fossiliferous beds, yet more than ninety of
them are enumerated by Heer as belonging to this falunian division,
and of these more than half are common to subjacent Lower Miocene
beds, while a proportion of about forty-five in one hundred are
common to the overlying &OElig;ningen flora. Twenty-six of the
ninety-two species are peculiar.</p>

<p><b>Upper Miocene of the Bolderberg, in Belgium.</b>&mdash;In a
small hill or ridge called the Bolderberg, which I visited in 1851,
situated near Hasselt, about forty miles E.N.E. of Brussels, strata
of sand and gravel occur, to which M. Dumont first called attention
as appearing to constitute a northern representative of the faluns
of Touraine. On the whole, they are very distinct in their fossils
from the two upper divisions of the Antwerp Crag before mentioned
<a href="ch13.html#page 204">(p. 204)</a>, and contain shells of
the genera <i>Oliva, Conus, Ancillaria, Pleurotoma,</i> and <i>
Cancellaria</i> in abundance. The most common shell is an Olive
(Fig. 146), called by Nyst <i>Oliva Dufresnii</i>; and
constituting, as M. Bosquet observes, a smaller and shorter variety
of the Bordeaux species.</p>

<p>So far as the shells of the Bolderberg are known, the proportion
of recent species agrees with that in the faluns of Touraine, and
the climate must have been warmer than that of the Coralline Crag
of England.</p>

<p><b>Upper Miocene Beds of the Vienna Basin.</b>&mdash;In South
Germany the general resemblance of the shells of the Vienna
tertiary basin with those of the faluns of Touraine has long been
acknowledged. In the late Dr. H&ouml;rnes&rsquo;s excellent
work</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 225">[ 225 ]</a></p>

<p>on the fossil mollusca of that formation, we see accurate
figures of many shells, clearly of the same species as those found
in the falunian sands of Touraine.</p>

<p>According to Professor Suess, the most ancient and purely marine
of the Miocene strata in this basin consist of sands,
conglomerates, limestones, and clays, and they are inclined inward,
or from the borders of the trough towards the centre, their
outcropping edges rising much higher than the newer beds, whether
Miocene or Pliocene, which overlie them, and which occupy a smaller
area at an inferior elevation above the sea. M. Hornes has
described no less than 500 species of gasteropods, of which he
identifies one-fifth with living species of the Mediterranean,
Indian, or African seas, but the proportion of existing species
among the lamellibranchiate bivalves exceeds this average. Among
many univalves agreeing with those of Africa on the eastern side of
the Atlantic are <i>Cypr&aelig;a sanguinolenta, Buccinum
lyratum,</i> and <i>Oliva flammulata.</i> In the lowest marine beds
of the Vienna basin the remains of several mammalia have been
found, and among them a species of <i>Dinotherium</i>, a Mastodon
of the <i>Trilophodon</i> family, a Rhinoceros (allied to <i>R.
megarhinus</i>, Christol), also an animal of the hog tribe, <i>
Listriodon</i>, von Meyer, and a carnivorous animal of the canine
family. The <i>Helix turonensis</i> <a href="images/fig38.jpg">
(Fig. 38)</a>, the most common land shell of the French faluns,
accompanies the above land animals. In a higher member of the
Vienna Miocene series are found <i>Dinotherium giganteum</i> <a
href="images1/fig136.jpg">(Fig. 136)</a>, <i>Mastodon longirostris,
Rhinoceros Schleiermacheri, Acerotherium incisivum,</i> and <i>
Hippotherium gracile,</i> all of them equally characteristic of an
Upper Miocene deposit occurring at Eppelsheim, in Hesse Darmstadt;
a locality also remarkable as having furnished in latitude 49&deg;
50' N. the bone of a large ape of the Gibbon kind, the most
northerly example yet discovered of a quadrumanous animal.</p>

<img src="images1/fig147.jpg" width="130" height="164" alt=
"Fig. 147: Amphistegina Hauerina." align="right"> 

<p>M. Alcide d&rsquo;Orbigny has shown that the foraminifera of the
Vienna basin differ alike from the Eocene and Pliocene species, and
agree with those of the faluns, so far as the latter are known.
Among the Vienna foraminifera, the genus <i>Amphistegina</i> (Fig.
147) is very characteristic, and is supposed by d&rsquo;Archiac to
take the same place among the Rhizopods of the Upper Miocene era
which the Nummulites occupy in the Eocene period.</p>

<p>The flora of the Vienna basin exhibits some species which</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 226">[ 226 ]</a></p>

<p>have a general range through the whole Miocene period, such as
<i>Cinnamomum polymorphum</i> <a href="images1/fig138.jpg">(Fig.
138)</a>, and <i>C. Scheuchzeri,</i> also Planera Richardi, Mich.,
<i>Liquidambar europ&aelig;um</i> <a href="images1/fig134.jpg">
(Fig. 135)</a> <i>Juglans bilinica, Cassia ambigua,</i> and <i>C.
lignitum.</i> Among the plants common to the Upper Miocene beds of
&OElig;ningen, in Switzerland, are <i>Platanus aceroides</i> <a
href="images1/fig141.jpg">(Fig. 141)</a>, <i>Myrica
vindobonensis,</i> and others.</p>

<p><b>Upper Miocene Strata of Italy.</b>&mdash;We are indebted to
Signor Michelotti for a valuable work on the Miocene shells of
Northern Italy. Those found in the hill called the Superga, near
Turin, have long been known to correspond in age with the faluns of
Touraine, and they contain so many species common to the Upper
Miocene strata of Bordeaux as to lead to the conclusion that there
was a free communication between the northern part of the
Mediterranean and the Bay of Biscay in the Upper Miocene
period.</p>

<p><b>Upper Miocene Formations of Greece.</b>&mdash;At
Pikerm&eacute;, near Athens, MM. Wagner and Roth have described a
deposit in which they found the remains of the genera <i>Mastodon,
Dinotherium, Hipparion,</i> two species of <i>Giraffe,
Antelope,</i> and others, some living and some extinct. With them
were also associated fossil bones of the <i>Semnopithecus,</i>
showing that here, as in the south of France, the quadrumana were
characteristic of this period. The whole fauna attests the former
extension of a vast expanse of grassy plains where we have now the
broken and mountainous country of Greece; plains, which were
probably united with Asia Minor, spreading over the area where the
deep &AElig;gean Sea and its numerous islands are now situated. We
are indebted to M. Gaudry, who visited Pikerm&eacute;, for a
treatise on these fossil bones, showing how many data they
contribute to the theory of a transition from the mammalia of the
Upper Miocene through the Pliocene and Post-pliocene forms to those
of living genera and species.</p>

<p><b>Upper Miocene of India. Siw&acirc;lik Hills.</b>&mdash;The
Siw&acirc;lik Hills lie at the southern foot of the Himalayan
chain, rising to the height of 2000 and 3000 feet. Between the
Jumna and the Ganges they consist of inclined strata of sandstone,
shingle, clay, and marl. We are indebted to the indefatigable
researches of Dr. Falconer and Sir Proby Cautley, continued for
fifteen years, for the discovery in these marls and sandstones of a
great variety of fossil mammalia and reptiles, together with many
fresh-water shells. Out of fifteen species of shells of the genera
<i>Paludina, Melania, Ampullaria,</i> and <i>Unio,</i> all are
extinct or unknown species with the exception of four, which are
still inhabitants of Indian rivers. Such a</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 227">[ 227 ]</a></p>

<p>proportion of living to extinct mollusca agrees well with the
usual character of an Upper Miocene or Falunian fauna, as observed
in Touraine, or in the basin of Vienna and elsewhere.</p>

<p>The genera of mammalia point in the same direction. One of them,
of the genus <i>Chalicotherium</i> (or <i>Anisodon</i> of Lartet),
is a pachyderm intermediate between the <i>Rhinoceros</i> and <i>
Anoplothere,</i> and characteristic of the Upper Miocene strata of
Eppelsheim, and of the south of France. With it occurs also an
extinct form of Hippopotamus, called Hexaprotodon, and a species of
Hippotherium and pig, also two species of <i>Mastodon</i>, two of
elephant, and three other elephantine proboscidians; none of them
agreeing with any fossil forms of Europe, and being intermediate
between the genera Elephas and Mastodon, constituting the sub-genus
<i>Stegodon</i> of Falconer. With these are associated a monkey,
allied to the <i>Semnopithecus entellus</i>, now living in the
Himalaya, and many ruminants. Among these last, besides the
giraffe, camel, antelope, stag, and others, we find a remarkable
new type, the <i>Sivatherium,</i> like a gigantic four-horned deer.
There are also new forms of carnivora, both feline and canine, the
<i>Machairodus</i> among the former, also hy&aelig;nas, and a
subursine form called the Hy&aelig;narctos, and a genus allied to
the otter (<i>Enhydriodon</i>), of formidable size.</p>

<p>The giraffe, camel, and a large ostrich may be cited as proofs
that there were formerly extensive plains where now a steep chain
of hills, with deep ravines, runs for many hundred miles east and
west. Among the accompanying reptiles are several crocodiles, some
of huge dimensions, and one not distinguishable, says Dr. Falconer,
from a species now living in the Ganges (<i>C. Gangeticus</i>); and
there is still another saurian which the same anatomist has
identified with a species now inhabiting India. There was also an
extinct species of tortoise of gigantic proportions
(<i>Colossochelys Atlas</i>), the curved shell of which was twelve
feet three inches long and eight feet in diameter, the entire
length of the animal being estimated at eighteen feet, and its
probable height seven feet.</p>

<p>Numerous fossils of the Siw&acirc;lik type have also been found
in Perim Island, in the Gulf of Cambay, and among these a species
of <i>Dinotherium,</i> a genus so characteristic of the Upper
Miocene period in Europe.</p>

<p><b>Older Pliocene and Miocene Formations in the United
States.</b>&mdash;Between the Alleghany Mountains, formed of older
rocks, and the Atlantic, there intervenes, in the United States, a
low region occupied principally by beds of marl, clay, and sand,
consisting of the cretaceous and tertiary formations,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 228">[ 228 ]</a></p>

<p>and chiefly of the latter. The general elevation of this plain
bordering the Atlantic does not exceed 100 feet, although it is
sometimes several hundred feet high. Its width in the middle and
southern states is very commonly from 100 to 150 miles. It
consists, in the South, as in Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina,
almost exclusively of Eocene deposits; but in North Carolina,
Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, more modern strata predominate, of
the age of the English Crag and faluns of Touraine.*</p>

<p>In the Virginian sands, we find in great abundance a species of
Astarte (<i>A. undulata,</i> Conrad), which resembles closely, and
may possibly be a variety of, one of the commonest fossils of the
Suffolk Crag (<i>A. Omalii</i>); the other shells also, of the
genera <i>Natica, Fissurella, Artemis, Lucina, Chama,
Pectunculus,</i> and <i>Pecten,</i> are analagous to shells both of
the English Crag and French faluns, although the species are almost
all distinct. Out of 147 of these American fossils I could only
find thirteen species common to Europe, and these occur partly in
the Suffolk Crag, and partly in the faluns of Touraine; but it is
an important characteristic of the American group, that it not only
contains many peculiar extinct forms, such as <i>Fusus
quadricostatus,</i> Say (see Fig. 149), and <i>Venus
tridacnoides,</i> abundant in these same formations, but also some
shells which, like <i>Fulgur carica</i> of Say and <i>F.
canaliculatus</i> (see Fig. 148), <i>Calyptr&aelig;a costata, Venus
mercenaria,</i> Lam., <i>Modiola glandula,</i> Totten, and <i>
Pecten magellanicus,</i> Lam., are recent species, yet of forms now
confined to the western side of the Atlantic&mdash;a fact implying
that some traces of the beginning of the present geographical
distribution of mollusca</p>

<p>Of ten species of corals which I procured on the banks of the
James River, one agrees generically with a coral now living on the
coast of the United States. Mr. Lonsdale regarded these corals as
indicating a temperature exceeding that of the Mediterranean, and
the shells would lead to similar conclusions. Those occurring on
the James River are in the 37th degree of N. latitude, while the
French faluns are in the 47th; yet the forms of the American
fossils would scarcely imply so warm a climate as must have
prevailed in France when the Miocene strata of Touraine
originated.</p>

<p>Among the remains of fish in these post-eocene strata of the
United States are several large teeth of the shark family, not
distinguishable specifically from fossils of the faluns of
Touraine.</p>
