Rocks. &mdash; Granite protruded in a solid Form.</p>

<p>When we adopt the igneous theory of granite, as explained in the
last chapter, and believe that different Plutonic rocks have
originated at successive periods beneath the surface of the planet,
we must be prepared to encounter greater difficulty in ascertaining
the precise age of such rocks than in the case of volcanic and
fossiliferous formations. We must bear in mind that the evidence of
the age of each contemporaneous volcanic rock was derived either
from lavas poured out upon the ancient surface, whether in the sea
or in the atmosphere, or from tuffs and conglomerates, also
deposited at the surface, and either containing organic remains
themselves or intercalated between strata containing fossils. But
the same tests entirely fail, or are only applicable in a modified
degree, when we endeavour to fix the chronology of a rock which has
crystallised from a state of fusion in the bowels of the earth. In
that case we are reduced to the tests of relative position,
intrusion, alteration of the rocks in contact, included fragments,
and mineral character; but all these may yield at best a somewhat
ambiguous result.</p>

<p><b>Test of Age by Relative Position.</b>&mdash;Unaltered
fossiliferous strata of every age are met with reposing immediately
on Plutonic rocks; as at Christiania, in Norway, where the
Post-pliocene deposits rest on granite; in Auvergne, where the
fresh-water Miocene strata, and at Heidelberg, on the Rhine, where
the New Red sandstone occupy a similar place. In all these, and
similar instances, inferiority in position is connected with the
superior antiquity of granite. The crystalline rock was solid
before the sedimentary beds were superimposed, and the latter
usually contain in them rounded pebbles of the subjacent
granite.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 565">[ 565 ]</a></p>

<p><b>Test by Intrusion and Alteration.</b>&mdash;But when Plutonic
rocks send veins into strata, and alter them near the point of
contact, in the manner before described (<a href=
"ch31.html#page 559">p. 559</a>), it is clear that, like intrusive
traps, they are newer than the strata which they invade and alter.
Examples of the application of this test will be given in the
sequel.</p>

<p><b>Test by Mineral Composition.</b>&mdash;Notwithstanding a
general uniformity in the aspect of Plutonic rocks, we have seen in
the last chapter that there are many varieties, such as syenite,
talcose granite, and others. One of these varieties is sometimes
found exclusively prevailing throughout an extensive region, where
it preserves a homogeneous character; so that, having ascertained
its relative age in one place, we can recognise its identity in
others, and thus determine from a single section the chronological
relations of large mountain masses. Having observed, for example,
that the syenitic granite of Norway, in which the mineral called
zircon abounds, has altered the Silurian strata wherever it is in
contact, we do not hesitate to refer other masses of the same
zircon-syenite in the south of Norway to a post-Silurian date. Some
have imagined that the age of different granites might, to a great
extent, be determined by their mineral characters alone; syenite,
for instance, or granite with hornblende, being more modern than
common or micaceous granite. But modern investigations have proved
these generalisations to have been premature.</p>

<p><b>Test by Included Fragments.</b>&mdash;This criterion can
rarely be of much importance, because the fragments involved in
granite are usually so much altered that they can not be referred
with certainty to the rocks whence they were derived. In the White
Mountains, in North America, according to Professor Hubbard, a
granite vein, traversing granite, contains fragments of slate and
trap which must have fallen into the fissure when the fused
materials of the vein were injected from below,* and thus the
granite is shown to be newer than those slaty and trappean
formations from which the fragments were derived.</p>

<p><b>Recent and Pliocene Plutonic Rocks, why
invisible.</b>&mdash;The explanations already given in the 28th and
in the last chapter of the probable relation of the Plutonic to the
volcanic formations, will naturally lead the reader to infer that
rocks of the one class can never be produced at or near the surface
without some members of the other being formed below. It is not
uncommon for lava-streams to require more than ten years to cool in
the open air; and where they are of great</p>

<p>depth, a much longer period. The melted matter poured from
Jorullo, in Mexico, in the year 1759, which accumulated in some
places to the height of 550 feet, was found to retain a high
temperature half a century after the eruption.* We may conceive,
therefore, that great masses of subterranean lava may remain in a
red-hot or incandescent state in the volcanic foci for immense
periods, and the process of refrigeration may be extremely gradual.
Sometimes, indeed, this process may be retarded for an indefinite
period by the accession of fresh supplies of heat; for we find that
the lava in the crater of Stromboli, one of the Lipari Islands, has
been in a state of constant ebullition for the last two thousand
years; and we may suppose this fluid mass to communicate with some
caldron or reservoir of fused matter below. In the Isle of Bourbon,
also, where there has been an emission of lava once in every two
years for a long period, the lava below can scarcely fail to have
been permanently in a state of liquefaction. If then it be a
reasonable conjecture, that about 2000 volcanic eruptions occur in
the course of every century, either above the waters of the sea or
beneath them,&dagger; it will follow that the quantity of Plutonic
rock generated or in progress during the Recent epoch must already
have been considerable.</p>

<p>But as the Plutonic rocks originate at some depth in the
earth&rsquo;s crust, they can only be rendered accessible to human
observation by subsequent upheaval and denudation. Between the
period when a Plutonic rock crystallises in the subterranean
regions and the era of its protrusion at any single point of the
surface, one or two geological periods must usually intervene.
Hence, we must not expect to find the Recent or even the Pliocene
granites laid open to view, unless we are prepared to assume that
sufficient time has elapsed since the commencement of the Pliocene
period for great upheaval and denudation. A Plutonic rock,
therefore, must, in general, be of considerable antiquity
relatively to the fossiliferous and volcanic formations, before it
becomes extensively visible. As we know that the upheaval of land
has been sometimes accompanied in South America by volcanic
eruptions and the emission of lava, we may conceive the more
ancient Plutonic rocks to be forced upward to the surface by the
newer rocks of the same class formed successively
below&mdash;subterposition in the Plutonic, like superposition in the
sedimentary rocks, being usually characteristic of a newer
origin.</p>

<p>In Fig. 617 an attempt is made to show the inverted order in
which sedimentary and Plutonic formations may occur in the
earth&rsquo;s crust. The oldest Plutonic rock, No. I, has been
upheaved at successive periods until it has become exposed to view
in a mountain-</p>

<p>chain. This protrusion of No. I has been caused by the igneous
agency which produced the newer Plutonic rocks Nos. II, III and IV.
Part of the primary fossiliferous strata, No. I, have also been
raised to the surface by the same gradual process. It will be
observed that the Recent <i>strata</i> No. 4 and the Recent <i>
granite</i> or Plutonic rock No. IV are the most remote from each
other in position, although of contemporaneous date. According to
this hypothesis, the convulsions of many periods will be required
before Recent or Post-tertiary granite will be upraised so as to
form the highest ridges and central axes of mountain-chains. During
that time the <i>recent</i> strata No. 4 might be covered by a
great many newer sedimentary formations.</p>

<p><b>Miocene Plutonic Rocks.</b>&mdash;A considerable mass of
syenite, in the Isle of Skye, is described by Dr. MacCulloch as
intersecting limestone and shale, which are of the age of the lias.
The limestone, which at a greater distance from the granite
contains shells, exhibits no traces of them near its junction,
where it has been converted into a pure crystalline marble.*
MacCulloch pointed out that the syenite here, as in Raasay, was
newer than the secondary rocks, and Mr. Geikie has since shown that
there is a strong probability that this Plutonic rock may be of
Miocene age, because a similar Syenite having a true granitic
character in its crystallisation has modified the Tertiary volcanic
rocks of Ben More, in Mull, some of which have undergone
considerable metamorphism.</p>

<p><b>Eocene Plutonic Rocks.</b>&mdash;In a former part of this
volume (Chapter 16), the great nummulitic formation of the Alps and
Pyrenees was referred to the Eocene period, and it follows that
vast movements which have raised those fossiliferous rocks from the
level of the sea to the height of more than 10,000 feet above its
level have taken place since the commencement of the Tertiary
epoch. Here, therefore, if anywhere, we might expect to find
hypogene formations of Eocene date breaking out in the central axis
or most disturbed region of the loftiest chain in Europe.
Accordingly, in the Swiss Alps, even the <i>flysch,</i> or upper
portion of the nummulitic series, has been occasionally invaded by
Plutonic rocks, and converted into crystalline schists of the
hypogene class. There can be little doubt that even the talcose
granite or gneiss of Mont Blanc itself has been in a fused or pasty
state since the <i>flysch</i> was deposited at the bottom of the
sea; and the question as to its age is not so much whether it be a
secondary or tertiary granite or gneiss, as whether it should be
assigned to the Eocene or Miocene epoch.</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 569">[ 569 ]</a></p>

<p>Great upheaving movements have been experienced in the region of
the Andes, during the Post-tertiary period. In some part,
therefore, of this chain, we may expect to discover tertiary
Plutonic rocks laid open to view; and Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s account of
the Chilian Andes, to which the reader may refer, fully realises
this expectation: for he shows that we have strong ground to
presume that Plutonic rocks there exposed on a large scale are of
later date than certain Secondary and Tertiary formations.</p>

<p>But the theory adopted in this work of the subterranean origin
of the hypogene formations would be untenable, if the supposed fact
here alluded to, of the appearance of tertiary granite at the
surface, was not a rare exception to the general rule. A
considerable lapse of time must intervene between the formation of
Plutonic and metamorphic rocks in the nether regions and their
emergence at the surface. For a long series of subterranean
movements must occur before such rocks can be uplifted into the
atmosphere or the ocean; and, before they can be rendered visible
to man, some strata which previously covered them must have been
stripped off by denudation.</p>

<p>We know that in the Bay of Bai&aelig; in 1538, in Cutch in 1819,
and on several occasions in Peru and Chili, since the commencement
of the present century, the permanent upheaval or subsidence of
land has been accompanied by the simultaneous emission of lava at
one or more points in the same volcanic region. From these and
other examples it may be inferred that the rising or sinking of the
earth&rsquo;s crust, operations by which sea is converted into
land, and land into sea, are a part only of the consequences of
subterranean igneous action. It can scarcely be doubted that this
action consists, in a great degree, of the baking, and occasionally
the liquefaction, of rocks, causing them to assume, in some cases a
larger, in others a smaller volume than before the application of
heat. It consists also in the generation of gases, and their
expansion by heat, and the injection of liquid matter into rents
formed in superincumbent rocks. The prodigious scale on which these
subterranean causes have operated in Sicily since the deposition of
the Newer Pliocene strata will be appreciated when we remember that
throughout half the surface of that island such strata are met
with, raised to the height of from 50 to that of 2000 and even 3000
feet above the level of the sea. In the same island also the older
rocks which are contiguous to these marine tertiary strata must
have undergone, within the same period, a similar amount of
upheaval.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 570">[ 570 ]</a></p>

<p>The like observations may be extended to nearly the whole of
Europe, for, since the commencement of the Eocene Period, the
entire European area, including some of the central and very lofty
portions of the Alps themselves, as I have elsewhere shown,* has,
with the exception of a few districts, emerged from the deep to its
present altitude. There must, therefore, have been at great depths
in the earth&rsquo;s crust, within the same period, an amount of
subterranean change corresponding to this vast alteration of level
affecting a whole continent.</p>

<p>The principal effect of subterranean movements during the
Tertiary Period seems to have consisted in the upheaval of hypogene
formations of an age anterior to the Carboniferous. The repetition
of another series of movements, of equal violence, might upraise
the Plutonic and metamorphic rocks of many secondary periods; and,
if the same force should still continue to act, the next
convulsions might bring up to the day the <i>tertiary</i> and <i>
recent</i> hypogene rocks. In the course of such changes many of
the existing sedimentary strata would suffer greatly by denudation,
others might assume a metamorphic structure, or become melted down
into Plutonic and volcanic rocks. Meanwhile the deposition of a
great thickness of new strata would not fail to take place during
the upheaval and partial destruction of the older rocks. But I must
refer the reader to the last chapter but one of this volume for a
fuller explanation of these views.</p>

<p><b>Plutonic Rocks of Cretaceous Period.</b>&mdash;It will be
shown in the next chapter that chalk, as well as lias, has been
altered by granite in the eastern Pyrenees. Whether such granite be
cretaceous or tertiary, can not easily be decided. Suppose <i>b, c,

lowest of which, <i>b,</i> has been altered by the granite A, the
modifying influence not having extended so far as <i>c,</i> or

"Fig. 619: Junction of granite with Jurassic or Oolite strata in the Alps, near Champoleon."
 align="right"> 

<p><b>Plutonic Rocks of the Oolite and Lias.</b>&mdash;In the
Department of the Hautes Alpes, in France, M. &Eacute;lie de
Beaumont traced a black argillaceous limestone, charged with
belemnites, to within a few yards of a mass of granite. Here the
limestone begins to put on a granular texture, but is extremely
fine-grained. When nearer the junction it becomes grey, and has a
saccharoid structure. In another locality, near Champoleon, a
granite composed of quartz, black mica, and rose-coloured feldspar
is observed partly to overlie the secondary rocks, producing an
alteration which extends for about 30 feet downward, diminishing in
the beds which lie farthest from the granite. (See Fig. 619.) In
the altered mass the argillaceous beds are hardened, the limestone
is saccharoid, the grits quartzose, and in the midst of them is a
thin layer of an imperfect granite. It is also an important
circumstance that near the point of contact, both the granite and
the secondary rocks become metalliferous, and contain nests and
small veins of blende, galena, iron, and copper pyrites. The
stratified rocks become harder and more crystalline, but the
granite, on the contrary, softer and less perfectly crystallised
near the junction.* Although the granite is incumbent in the
section (Fig. 619), we can not assume that it overflowed the
strata, for the disturbances of the rocks are so great in this part
of the Alps that their original position is often inverted.</p>

<p>At Predazzo, in the Tyrol, secondary strata, some of which are
limestones of the Oolitic period, have been traversed and altered
by Plutonic rocks, one portion of which is an augitic porphyry,
which passes insensibly into granite. The limestone</p>

<p>is changed into granular marble, with a band of serpentine at
the junction.*</p>

<p><b>Plutonic Rocks of Carboniferous Period.</b>&mdash;The granite
of Dartmoor, in Devonshire, was formerly supposed to be one of the
most ancient of the Plutonic rocks, but is now ascertained to be
posterior in date to the culm-measures of that county, which from
their position, and, as containing true coal-plants, are now known
to be members of the true Carboniferous series. This granite, like
the syenitic granite of Christiania, has broken through the
stratified formations, on the north-west side of Dartmoor, the
successive members of the culm-measures abutting against the
granite, and becoming metamorphic as they approach. These strata
are also penetrated by granite veins, and Plutonic dikes, called
&ldquo;elvans.&rdquo;&dagger; The granite of Cornwall is probably
of the same date, and, therefore, as modern as the Carboniferous
strata, if not newer.</p>

<center><img src="images5/fig620.jpg" width="338" height="94" alt=
"Fig. 620: Section through Silurian strata and Granite."></center>

<p><b>Plutonic Rocks of Silurian Period.</b>&mdash;It has long been
known that a very ancient granite near Christiania, in Norway, is
posterior in date to the Lower Silurian strata of that region,
although its exact position in the Pal&aelig;ozoic series can not
be defined. Von Buch first announced, in 1813, that it was of newer
origin than certain limestones containing orthocerata and
trilobites. The proofs consist in the penetration of granite veins
into the shale and limestone, and the alteration of the strata, for
a considerable distance from the point of contact, both of these
veins and the central mass from which they emanate. (See <a href=
"ch31.html#page 562">p. 562</a>) Von Buch supposed that the
Plutonic rock alternated with the fossiliferous strata, and that
large masses of granite were sometimes incumbent upon the strata;
but this idea was erroneous, and arose from the fact that the beds
of shale and limestone often dip towards the granite up to the
point of contact, appearing as if they would pass under it in mass,
as at <i>a,</i> Fig. 620, and then again on the opposite side of
the same mountain, as at <i>b,</i> dip away from the same granite.
When the junctions, however, are carefully examined, it is found
that the Plutonic rock</p>

<p class="fnote">* Von Buch, Annales de Chimie, etc.<br>

series, vol. v, p. 686.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 573">[ 573 ]</a></p>

<p>intrudes itself in veins, and nowhere covers the fossiliferous
strata in large overlying masses, as is so commonly the case with
trappean formations.*</p>

<p>Now this granite, which is more modern than the Silurian strata
of Norway, also sends veins in the same country into an ancient
formation of gneiss; and the relations of the Plutonic rock and the
gneiss, at their junction, are full of interest when we duly
consider the wide difference of epoch which must have separated
their origin.</p>

<center><img src="images5/fig621.jpg" width="334" height="146" alt=
"Fig. 621: Granite sending veins into Silurian strata and gneiss. Christiania, Norway.">
</center>

<p>The length of this interval of time is attested by the following
facts: The fossiliferous, or Silurian, beds rest unconformably upon
the truncated edges of the gneiss, the inclined strata of which had
been denuded before the sedimentary beds were superimposed (see
Figure 621). The signs of denudation are twofold; first, the
surface of the gneiss is seen occasionally, on the removal of the
newer beds containing organic remains, to be worn and smoothed;
secondly, pebbles of gneiss have been found in some of these
Silurian strata. Between the origin, therefore, of the gneiss and
the granite there intervened, first, the period when the strata of
gneiss were denuded; secondly, the period of the deposition of the
Silurian deposits upon the denuded and inclined gneiss, a. Yet the
granite produced after this long interval is often so intimately
blended with the ancient gneiss, at the point of junction, that it
is impossible to draw any other than an arbitrary line of
separation between them; and where this is not the case, tortuous
veins of granite pass freely through gneiss, ending sometimes in
threads, as if the older rock had offered no resistance to their
passage. These appearances may probably be due to hydrothermal
action (see <a href="ch33.html#page 584">p. 584</a>). I shall
merely observe in this place that had such junctions alone been
visible, and had we not learnt, from other sections, how long a
period elapsed between the consolidation of the gneiss and the
injection of this granite, we might have suspected that the gneiss
was scarcely solidified,</p>

<p class="fnote">* See the G&aelig;a Norvegica and other works of
Keilhau, with whom I examined this country.</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 574">[ 574 ]</a></p>

<p>or had not yet assumed its complete metamorphic character when
invaded by the Plutonic rock. From this example we may learn how
impossible it is to conjecture whether certain granites in
Scotland, and other countries, which send veins into gneiss and
other metamorphic rocks, are primary, or whether they may not
belong to some secondary or tertiary period.</p>

<p><b>Oldest Granites.</b>&mdash;It is not half a century since the
doctrine was very general that all granitic rocks were <i>
primitive,</i> that is to say, that they originated before the
deposition of the first sedimentary strata, and before the creation
of organic beings (see <a href="ch1.html#page 34">p. 34</a>). But
so greatly are our views now changed, that we find it no easy task
to point out a single mass of granite demonstrably more ancient
than known fossiliferous deposits. Could we discover some
Laurentian strata resting immediately on granite, there being no
alterations at the point of contact, nor any intersecting granitic
veins, we might then affirm the Plutonic rock to have originated
before the oldest known fossiliferous strata. Still it would be
presumptuous, as we have already pointed out (<a href=
"ch26.html#page 464">p. 464</a>), to suppose that when a small part
only of the globe has been investigated, we are acquainted with the
oldest fossiliferous strata in the crust of our planet. Even when
these are found, we can not assume that there never were any
antecedent strata containing organic remains, which may have become
metamorphic. If we find pebbles of granite in a conglomerate of the
Lower Laurentian system, we may then feel assured that the parent
granite was formed before the Laurentian formation. But if the
incumbent strata be merely Cambrian or Silurian, the fundamental
granite, although of high antiquity, may be posterior in date to
<i>known</i> fossiliferous formations.</p>

<p><b>Protrusion of Solid Granite.</b>&mdash;In part of
Sutherlandshire, near Brora, common granite, composed of feldspar,
quartz, and mica is in immediate contact with Oolitic strata, and
has clearly been elevated to the surface at a period subsequent to
the deposition of those strata.* Professor Sedgwick and Sir R.
Murchison conceive that this granite has been upheaved in a solid
form; and that in breaking through the submarine deposits, with
which it was not perhaps originally in contact, it has fractured
them so as to form a breccia along the line of junction. This
breccia consists of fragments of shale, sandstone, and limestone,
with fossils of the oolite, all united together by a calcareous
cement. The secondary strata at some distance from the granite are
but slightly disturbed, but in proportion to their proximity the
amount of dislocation becomes greater.</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 575">[ 575 ]</a></p>

<p>Mr. T. McKenney Hughes has suggested to me in explanation of
these phenomena that they may be the effect of the association of
more pliant strata with hard unyielding rocks, the whole of which
were subjected simultaneously to great movements, whether of
elevation or subsidence, and of lateral pressure, during which the
more solid granite, being incapable of compression, was forced
through the softer beds of shale, sandstone, and limestone. He
remarks that similar breccias with slickensides are observed on a
minor scale where rocks of different composition and rigidity are
contorted together. Such protrusion may have been brought about by
degrees by innumerable shocks of earthquakes repeated after long
intervals of time along the same tract of country. The opening of
new fissures in the hardest rocks is a frequent accompaniment of
such convulsions, and during the consequent vibrations, breccias
