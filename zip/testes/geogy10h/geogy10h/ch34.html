<p>We have already seen that chemical forces of great intensity
have frequently acted upon sedimentary and fossiliferous strata
long subsequently to their consolidation, and we may next inquire
whether the component minerals of the altered rocks usually arrange
themselves in planes parallel to the original planes of
stratification, or whether, after crystallisation, they more
commonly take up a different position.</p>

<p>In order to estimate fairly the merits of this question, we must
first define what is meant by the terms cleavage and foliation.
There are four distinct forms of structure exhibited in rocks,
namely, stratification, joints, slaty cleavage, and foliation; and
all these must have different names, even though there be cases
where it is impossible, after carefully studying the appearances,
to decide upon the class to which they belong.</p>

<p><b>Slaty Cleavage.</b>&mdash;Professor Sedgwick, whose essay
&ldquo;On the Structure of large Mineral Masses&rdquo; first
cleared the way towards a better understanding of this difficult
subject, observes, that joints are distinguishable from lines of
slaty cleavage in this, that the rock intervening between two
joints has no tendency to cleave in a direction parallel to the
planes of the joints, whereas a rock is capable of indefinite
subdivision in the direction of its slaty cleavage. In cases where
the strata are curved, the planes of cleavage are still perfectly
parallel. This has been observed in the slate rocks of part of
Wales (see Fig. 624), which consists of a hard greenish slate. The
true bedding is there indicated by a number of parallel stripes,
some of a lighter and some of a darker colour than the general
mass. Such stripes are found to be parallel to the true planes of
stratification, wherever these are manifested by ripple-mark or by
beds</p>

<p>containing peculiar organic remains. Some of the contorted
strata are of a coarse mechanical structure, alternating with
fine-grained crystalline chloritic slates, in which case the same
slaty cleavage extends through the coarser and finer beds, though
it is brought out in greater perfection in proportion as the
materials of the rock are fine and homogeneous. It is only when
these are very coarse that the cleavage planes entirely vanish. In
the Welsh hills these planes are usually inclined at a very
considerable angle to the planes of the strata, the average angle
being as much as from 30&deg; to 40&deg;. Sometimes the cleavage
planes dip towards the same point of the compass as those of
stratification, but often to opposite points.* The cleavage, as
represented in Fig. 624, is generally constant over the whole of
any area affected by one great set of disturbances, as if the same
lateral pressure which caused the crumpling up of the rock along
parallel, anticlinal, and synclinal axes caused also the
cleavage.</p>

 align="right"> 

<p>Mr. T. McK. Hughes remarks, that where a rough cleavage cuts
flag-stones at a considerable angle to the planes of
stratification, the rock often splits into large slabs, across
which the lines of bedding are frequently seen, but when the
cleavage planes approach within about 15&deg; of stratification,
the rock is apt to split along the lines of bedding. He has also
called my attention to the fact that subsequent movements in a
cleaved rock sometimes drag and bend the cleavage planes along the
junction of the beds in the manner indicated in Fig. 625.</p>

<p><b>Jointed Structure.</b>&mdash;In regard to joints, they are
natural</p>

<p>fissures which often traverse rocks in straight and
well-determined lines. They afford to the quarryman, as Sir R.
Murchison observes, when speaking of the phenomenon, as exhibited
in Shropshire and the neighbouring counties, the greatest aid in
the extraction of blocks of stone; and, if a sufficient number
cross each other, the whole mass of rock is split into symmetrical
blocks. The faces of the joints are for the most part smoother and
more regular than the surfaces of true strata. The joints are
straight-cut chinks, sometimes slightly open, and often passing,
not only through layers of successive deposition, but also through
balls of limestone or other matter which have been formed by
concretionary action since the original accumulation of the strata.
Such joints, therefore, must often have resulted from one of the
last changes superinduced upon sedimentary deposits.*</p>

<center><img src="images5/fig626.jpg" width="344" height="194" alt=
"Fig. 626: Stratification, joints, and cleavage."></center>

<p>In Fig. 626 the flat-surfaces of rock, A, B, C, represent
exposed faces of joints, to which the walls of other joints, J J,
are parallel. S S are the lines of stratification; D D are lines of
slaty cleavage, which intersect the rock at a considerable angle to
the planes of stratification.</p>

<p>In the Swiss and Savoy Alps, as Mr. Bakewell has remarked,
enormous masses of limestone are cut through so regularly by nearly
vertical partings, and these joints are often so much more
conspicuous than the seams of stratification, that an inexperienced
observer will almost inevitably confound them, and suppose the
strata to be perpendicular in places where in fact they are almost
horizontal.&dagger;</p>

<p>Now such joints are supposed to be analogous to the partings
which separate volcanic and Plutonic rocks into cuboidal and
prismatic masses. On a small scale we see clay and starch when dry
split into similar shapes; this is often caused by simple
contraction, whether the shrinking be due</p>

<p>to the evaporation of water, or to a change of temperature. It
is well known that many sandstones and other rocks expand by the
application of moderate degrees of heat, and then contract again on
cooling; and there can be no doubt that large portions of the
earth&rsquo;s crust have, in the course of past ages, been
subjected again and again to very different degrees of heat and
cold. These alternations of temperature have probably contributed
largely to the production of joints in rocks.</p>

<p>In many countries where masses of basalt rest on sandstone, the
aqueous rock has, for the distance of several feet from the point
of junction, assumed a columnar structure similar to that of the
trap. In like manner some hearth-stones, after exposure to the heat
of a furnace without being melted, have become prismatic. Certain
crystals also acquire by the application of heat a new internal
arrangement, so as to break in a new direction, their external form
remaining unaltered.</p>

<p><b>Crystalline Theory of Cleavage.</b>&mdash;Professor Sedgwick,
speaking of the planes of slaty cleavage, where they are decidedly
distinct from those of sedimentary deposition, declared, in the
essay before alluded to, his opinion that no retreat of parts, no
contraction in the dimensions of rocks in passing to a solid state,
can account for the phenomenon. He accordingly referred it to
crystalline or polar forces acting simultaneously, and somewhat
uniformly, in given directions, on large masses having a
homogeneous composition.</p>

<p>Sir John Herschel, in allusion to slaty cleavage, has suggested
that &ldquo;if rocks have been so heated as to allow a commencement
of crystallisation&mdash;that is to say, if they have been heated
to a point at which the particles can begin to move among
themselves, or at least on their own axes, some general law must
then determine the position in which these particles will rest on
cooling. Probably, that position will have some relation to the
direction in which the heat escapes. Now, when all, or a majority
of particles of the same nature have a general tendency to one
position, that must of course determine a cleavage-plane. Thus we
see the infinitesimal crystals of fresh-precipitated sulphate of
barytes, and some other such bodies, arrange themselves alike in
the fluid in which they float; so as, when stirred, all to glance
with one light, and give the appearance of silky filaments. Some
sorts of soap, in which insoluble margarates* exist,</p>

<p class="fnote">* Margaric acid is an oleaginous acid, formed from
different animal and vegetable fatty substances. A margarate is a
compound of this acid with soda, potash, or some other base, and is
so named from its pearly lustre.</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 592">[ 592 ]</a></p>

<p>exhibit the same phenomenon when mixed with water; and what
occurs in our experiments on a minute scale may occur in nature on
a great one.&rdquo;*</p>

<p><b>Mechanical Theory of Cleavage.</b>&mdash;Professor Phillips
has remarked that in some slaty rocks the form of the outline of
fossil shells and trilobites has been much changed by distortion,
which has taken place in a longitudinal, transverse, or oblique
direction. This change, he adds, seems to be the result of a
&ldquo;creeping movement&rdquo; of the particles of the rock along
the planes of cleavage, its direction being always uniform over the
same tract of country, and its amount in space being sometimes
measurable, and being as much as a quarter or even half an inch.
The hard shells are not affected, but only those which are
thin.&dagger; Mr. D. Sharpe, following up the same line of inquiry,
came to the conclusion that the present distorted forms of the
shells in certain British slate rocks may be accounted for by
supposing that the rocks in which they are imbedded have undergone
compression in a direction perpendicular to the planes of cleavage,
and a corresponding expansion in the direction of the dip of the
cleavage.&Dagger;</p>

<p>Subsequently (1853) Mr. Sorby demonstrated the great extent to
which this mechanical theory is applicable to the slate rocks of
North Wales and Devonshire,&sect; districts where the amount of
change in dimensions can be tested and measured by comparing the
different effects exerted by lateral pressure on alternating beds
of finer and coarser materials. Thus, for example, in Fig. 627 it
will be seen that the sandy bed <i>d f,</i> which has offered
greater resistance, has been sharply contorted, while the
fine-grained strata, <i>a, b, c,</i> have remained comparatively
unbent. The points <i>d</i> and <i>f</i> in the stratum <i>d f</i>
must have been originally four times as far apart as they are now.
They have been forced so much nearer to each other, partly by
bending, and partly by becoming elongated in the direction of what
may be called the longer axes of their contortions, and lastly, to
a certain small amount, by condensation. The chief result has
obviously been due to the bending; but, in proof of elongation, it
will be observed that the thickness of the bed <i>d f</i> is now
about four times greater in those parts lying in the main direction
of the flexures than in a plane</p>

<p>perpendicular to them; and the same bed exhibits cleavage planes
in the direction of the greatest movement, although they are much
fewer than in the slaty strata above and below.</p>

<p>Above the sandy bed <i>d f,</i> the stratum <i>c</i> is somewhat
disturbed, while the next bed, <i>b,</i> is much less so, and a not
at all; yet all these beds, <i>c, b,</i> and <i>a,</i> must have
undergone an equal amount of pressure with <i>d,</i> the points a
and g having approximated as much towards each other as have <i>
d</i> and <i>f.</i> The same phenomena are also repeated in the
beds below <i>d,</i> and might have been shown, had the section
been extended downward. Hence it appears that the finer beds have
been squeezed into a fourth of the space they previously occupied,
partly by condensation, or the closer packing of their ultimate
particles (which has given rise to the great specific gravity of
such slates), and partly by elongation in the line of the dip of
the cleavage, of which the general direction is perpendicular to
that of the pressure. &ldquo;These and numerous other cases in
North Devon are analogous,&rdquo; says Mr. Sorby, &ldquo;to what
would occur if a strip of paper were included in a mass of some
soft plastic material which would readily change its dimensions. If
the whole were then compressed in the direction of the length of
the strip of paper, it would be bent and puckered up into
contortions, while the plastic material would readily change its
dimensions without undergoing such contortions; and the difference
in distance of the ends of the paper, as measured in a direct line
or along it, would indicate the change in the dimensions of the
plastic material.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By microscopic examination of minute crystals, and by</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 594">[ 594 ]</a></p>

<p>other observations, Mr. Sorby has come to the conclusion that
the absolute condensation of the slate rocks amounts upon an
average to about one half their original volume. Most of the scales
of mica occurring in certain slates examined by Mr. Sorby lie in
the plane of cleavage; whereas in a similar rock not exhibiting
cleavage they lie with their longer axes in all directions. May not
their position in the slates have been determined by the movement
of elongation before alluded to? To illustrate this theory some
scales of oxide of iron were mixed with soft pipe-clay in such a
manner that they inclined in all directions. The dimensions of the
mass were then changed artificially to a similar extent to what has
occurred in slate rocks, and the pipe-clay was then dried and
baked. When it was afterwards rubbed to a flat surface
perpendicular to the pressure and in the line of elongation, or in
a plane corresponding to that of the dip of cleavage, the particles
were found to have become arranged in the same manner as in natural
slates, and the mass admitted of easy fracture into thin flat
pieces in the plane alluded to, whereas it would not yield in that
perpendicular to the cleavage.*</p>

<p>Dr. Tyndall, when commenting in 1856 on Mr. Sorby&rsquo;s
experiments, observed that pressure alone is sufficient to produce
cleavage, and that the intervention of plates of mica or scales of
oxide of iron, or any other substances having flat surfaces, is
quite unnecessary. In proof of this he showed experimentally that a
mass of &ldquo;pure white wax, after having been submitted to great
pressure, exhibited a cleavage more clean than that of any
slate-rock, splitting into lamin&aelig; of surpassing
tenuity.&rdquo;&dagger; He remarks that every mass of clay or mud
is divided and subdivided by surfaces among which the cohesion is
comparatively small. On being subjected to pressure, such masses
yield and spread out in the direction of least resistance, small
nodules become converted into lamin&aelig; separated from each
other by surfaces of weak cohesion, and the result is that the mass
cleaves at right angles to the line in which the pressure is
exerted. In further illustration of this, Mr. Hughes remarks that
&ldquo;concretions which in the undisturbed beds have their longer
axes parallel to the bedding are, where the rock is much cleaved,
frequently found flattened laterally, so as to have their longer
axes parallel to the cleavage planes, and at a considerable angle,
even right angles, to their former position.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Darwin attributes the lamination and fissile structure</p>

<p>of volcanic rocks of the trachytic series, including some
obsidians in Ascension, Mexico, and elsewhere, to their having
moved when liquid in the direction of the lamin&aelig;. The zones
consist sometimes of layers of air-cells drawn out and lengthened
in the supposed direction of the moving mass.</p>

<p><b>Foliation of Crystalline Schists.</b>&mdash;After studying,
in 1835, the crystalline rocks of South America, Mr. Darwin
proposed the term <i>foliation</i> for the lamin&aelig; or plates
into which gneiss, mica-schist, and other crystalline rocks are
divided. Cleavage, he observes, may be applied to those divisional
planes which render a rock fissile, although it may appear to the
eye quite or nearly homogeneous. Foliation may be used for those
alternating layers or plates of different mineralogical nature of
which gneiss and other metamorphic schists are composed.</p>

<p>That the planes of foliation of the crystalline schists in
Norway accord very generally with those of original stratification
is a conclusion long since espoused by Keilhau.&dagger; Numerous
observations made by Mr. David Forbes in the same country (the best
probably in Europe for studying such phenomena on a grand scale)
confirm Keilhau&rsquo;s opinion. In Scotland, also, Mr. D. Forbes
has pointed out a striking case where the foliation is identical
with the lines of stratification in rocks well seen near
Crianlorich on the road to Tyndrum, about eight miles from
Inverarnon, in Perthshire. There is in that locality a blue
limestone foliated by the intercalation of small plates of white
mica, so that the rock is often scarcely distinguishable in aspect
from gneiss or mica-schist. The stratification is shown by the
large beds and coloured bands of limestone all dipping, like the
folia, at an angle of 32&deg; N.E.&Dagger; In stratified formations
of every age we see layers of siliceous sand with or without mica,
alternating with clay, with fragments of shells or corals, or with
seams of vegetable matter, and we should expect the mutual
attraction of like particles to favour the crystallisation of the
quartz, or mica, or feldspar, or carbonate of lime, along the
planes of original deposition, rather than in planes placed at
angles of 20 or 40 degrees to those of stratification.</p>

<p>We have seen how much the original planes of stratification may
be interfered with or even obliterated by concretionary action in
deposits still retaining their fossils, as in the case of the
magnesian limestone (see <a href="ch4.html#page 63">p. 63</a>).
Hence we must expect to be frequently baffled when we attempt to
decide</p>

<p>whether the foliation does or does not accord with that
arrangement which gravitation, combined with current-action,
imparted to a deposit from water. Moreover, when we look for
stratification in crystalline rocks, we must be on our guard not to
expect too much regularity. The occurrence of wedge-shaped masses,
such as belong to coarse sand and pebbles&mdash;diagonal lamination
(<a href="ch2.html#page 42">p. 42</a>)&mdash;ripple-marked,
unconformable stratification,&mdash;the fantastic folds produced by
lateral pressure&mdash;faults of various width&mdash;intrusive
dikes of trap&mdash;organic bodies of diversified shapes, and other
causes of unevenness in the planes of deposition, both on the small
and on the large scale, will interfere with parallelism. If complex
and enigmatical appearances did not present themselves, it would be
a serious objection to the metamorphic theory. Mr. Sorby has shown
that the peculiar structure belonging to ripple-marked sands, or
that which is generated when ripples are formed during the
deposition of the materials, is distinctly recognisable in many
varieties of mica-schists in Scotland.*</p>

<p>In Fig. 628 I have represented carefully the lamination of a
coarse argillaceous schist which I examined in 1830 in the
Pyrenees. In part it approaches in character to a green and blue
roofing-slate, while part is extremely quartzose, the whole mass
passing downward into micaceous schist. The vertical section here
exhibited is about three feet in height, and the layers are
sometimes so thin that fifty may be counted in the thickness of an
inch. Some of them consist of pure quartz. There is a resemblance
in such cases to the diagonal lamination which we see in
sedimentary rocks, even though the layers of quartz and of mica, or
of feldspar and other minerals, may be more distinct in alternating
folia than they were originally.</p>
