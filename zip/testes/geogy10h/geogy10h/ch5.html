ELEVATION OF STRATA ABOVE THE SEA.&mdash;HORIZONTAL AND INCLINED

<p><b>Land has been raised, not the Sea
lowered.</b>&mdash;It has been already stated that the
aqueous rocks containing marine fossils extend over wide
continental tracts, and are seen in mountain chains rising to great
heights above the level of the sea <a href="ch1.html#page 29">(p.
29)</a>. Hence it follows, that what is now dry land was once under
water. But if we admit this conclusion, we must imagine, either
that there has been a general lowering of the waters of the ocean,
or that the solid rocks, once covered by water, have been raised up
bodily out of the sea, and have thus become dry land. The earlier
geologists, finding themselves reduced to this alternative,
embraced the former opinion, assuming that the ocean was originally
universal, and had gradually sunk down to its actual level, so that
the present islands and continents were left dry. It seemed to them
far easier to conceive that the water had gone down, than that
solid land had risen upward into its present position. It was,
however, impossible to invent any satisfactory hypothesis to
explain the disappearance of so enormous a body of water throughout
the globe, it being necessary to infer that the ocean had once
stood at whatever height marine shells might be detected. It
moreover appeared clear, as the science of geology advanced, that
certain spaces on the globe had been alternately sea, then land,
then estuary, then sea again, and, lastly, once more habitable
land, having remained in each of these states for considerable
periods. In order to account for such phenomena</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 71">[ 71 ]</a></p>

<p>without admitting any movement of the land itself, we are
required to imagine several retreats and returns of the ocean; and
even then our theory applies merely to cases where the marine
strata composing the dry land are horizontal, leaving unexplained
those more common instances where strata are inclined, curved, or
placed on their edges, and evidently not in the position in which
they were first deposited.</p>

<p>Geologists, therefore, were at last compelled to have recourse
to the doctrine that the solid land has been repeatedly moved
upward or downward, so as permanently to change its position
relatively to the sea. There are several distinct grounds for
preferring this conclusion. First, it will account equally for the
position of those elevated masses of marine origin in which the
stratification remains horizontal, and for those in which the
strata are disturbed, broken, inclined, or vertical. Secondly, it
is consistent with human experience that land should rise gradually
in some places and be depressed in others. Such changes have
actually occurred in our own days, and are now in progress, having
been accompanied in some cases by violent convulsions, while in
others they have proceeded so insensibly as to have been
ascertainable only by the most careful scientific observations,
made at considerable intervals of time. On the other hand, there is
no evidence from human experience of a rising or lowering of the
sea&rsquo;s level in any region, and the ocean can not be raised or
depressed in one place without its level being changed all over the
globe.</p>

<p>These preliminary remarks will prepare the reader to understand
the great theoretical interest attached to all facts connected with
the position of strata, whether horizontal or inclined, curved or
vertical.</p>

<p>Now the first and most simple appearance is where strata of
marine origin occur above the level of the sea in horizontal
position. Such are the strata which we meet with in the south of
Sicily, filled with shells for the most part of the same species as
those now living in the Mediterranean. Some of these rocks rise to
the height of more than 2000 feet above the sea. Other mountain
masses might be mentioned, composed of horizontal strata of high
antiquity, which contain fossil remains of animals wholly
dissimilar from any now known to exist. In the south of Sweden, for
example, near Lake Wener, the beds of some of the oldest
fossiliferous deposits, called Silurian and Cambrian by geologists,
occur in as level a position as if they had recently formed part of
the delta of a great river, and been left dry</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 72">[ 72 ]</a></p>

<p>on the retiring of the annual floods. Aqueous rocks of equal
antiquity extend for hundreds of miles over the lake-district of
North America, and exhibit in like manner a stratification nearly
undisturbed. The Table Mountain at the Cape of Good Hope is another
example of highly elevated yet perfectly horizontal strata, no less
than 3500 feet in thickness, and consisting of sandstone of very
ancient date.</p>

<p>Instead of imagining that such fossiliferous rocks were always
at their present level, and that the sea was once high enough to
cover them, we suppose them to have constituted the ancient bed of
the ocean, and to have been afterwards uplifted to their present
height. This idea, however startling it may at first appear, is
quite in accordance, as before stated, with the analogy of changes
now going on in certain regions of the globe. Thus, in parts of
Sweden, and the shores and islands of the Gulf of Bothnia, proofs
have been obtained that the land is experiencing, and has
experienced for centuries, a slow upheaving movement.*</p>

<p>It appears from the observations of Mr. Darwin and others, that
very extensive regions of the continent of South America have been
undergoing slow and gradual upheaval, by which the level plains of
Patagonia, covered with recent marine shells, and the Pampas of
Buenos Ayres, have been raised above the level of the sea. On the
other hand, the gradual sinking of the west coast of Greenland, for
the space of more than 600 miles from north to south, during the
last four centuries, has been established by the observations of a
Danish naturalist, Dr. Pingel. And while these proofs of
continental elevation and subsidence, by slow and insensible
movements, have been recently brought to light, the evidence has
been daily strengthened of continued changes of level effected by
violent convulsions in countries where earthquakes are frequent.
There the rocks are rent from time to time, and heaved up or thrown
down several feet at once, and disturbed in such a manner as to
show how entirely the original position of strata may be modified
in the course of centuries.</p>

<p>Mr. Darwin has also inferred that, in those seas where circular
coral islands and barrier reefs abound, there is a slow and
continued sinking of the submarine mountains on which the masses of
coral are based; while there are other areas of the South Sea where
the land is on the rise, and where coral has been upheaved far
above the sea-level.</p>

<p><b>Alternations of Marine and Fresh-water
Strata.</b>&mdash;It has been shown in the third chapter
that there is such a difference</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 73">[ 73 ]</a></p>

<p>between land, fresh-water, and marine fossils as to enable the
geologist to determine whether particular groups of strata were
formed at the bottom of the ocean or in estuaries, rivers, or
lakes. If surprise was at first created by the discovery of marine
corals and shells at the height of several miles above the
sea-level, the imagination was afterwards not less startled by
observing that in the successive strata composing the earth&rsquo;s
crust, especially if their total thickness amounted to thousands of
feet, they comprised in some parts formations of shallow-sea as
well as of deep-sea origin; also beds of brackish or even of purely
fresh-water formation, as well as vegetable matter or coal
accumulated on ancient land. In these cases we as frequently find
fresh-water beds below a marine set or shallow-water under those of
deep-sea origin as the reverse. Thus, if we bore an artesian well
below London, we pass through a marine clay, and there reach, at
the depth of several hundred feet, a shallow-water and fluviatile
sand, beneath which comes the white chalk originally formed in a
deep sea. Or if we bore vertically through the chalk of the North
Downs, we come, after traversing marine chalky strata, upon a
fresh-water formation many hundreds of feet thick, called the
Wealden, such as is seen in Kent and Surrey, which is known in its
turn to rest on purely marine beds. In like manner, in various
parts of Great Britain we sink vertical shafts through marine
deposits of great thickness, and come upon coal which was formed by
the growth of plants on an ancient land-surface sometimes hundreds
of square miles in extent.</p>

<p><b>Vertical, Inclined, and Curved
Strata.</b>&mdash;It has been stated that marine strata of
different ages are sometimes found at a considerable height above
the sea, yet retaining their original horizontality; but this state
of things is quite exceptional. As a general rule, strata are
inclined or bent in such a manner as to imply that their original
position has been altered.</p>

<img src="images/fig54.jpg" width="172" height="152" alt=
"Fig. 54: Vertical conglomerate and sandstone." align="right"> 

<p>The most unequivocal evidence of such a change is afforded by
their standing up vertically, showing their edges, which is by no
means a rare phenomenon, especially in mountainous countries. Thus
we find in Scotland, on the southern skirts of the Grampians, beds
of pudding-stone alternating with thin layers of fine sand, all
placed vertically to the horizon. When Saussure first observed
certain conglomerates in a</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 74">[ 74 ]</a></p>

<p>similar position in the Swiss Alps, he remarked that the
pebbles, being for the most part of an oval shape, had their longer
axes parallel to the planes of stratification (see Fig. 54 on
preceding page). From this he inferred that such strata must, at
first, have been horizontal, each oval pebble having settled at the
bottom of the water, with its flatter side parallel to the horizon,
for the same reason that an egg will not stand on either end if
unsupported. Some few, indeed, of the rounded stones in a
conglomerate occasionally afford an exception to the above rule,
for the same reason that in a river&rsquo;s bed, or on a shingle beach,
some pebbles rest on their ends or edges; these having been shoved
against or between other stones by a wave or current, so as to
assume this position.</p>

<p><b>Anticlinal and Synclinal
Curves.</b>&mdash;Vertical strata, when they can be traced
continuously upward or downward for some depth, are almost
invariably seen to be parts of great curves, which may have a
diameter of a few yards, or of several miles. I shall first
describe two curves of considerable regularity, which occur in
Forfarshire, extending over a country twenty miles in breadth, from
the foot of the Grampians to the sea near Arbroath.</p>

<center><img src="images/fig55.jpg" width="597" height="197" alt=
"Fig. 55: Section of Forfarshire, from N.W. to S.E."></center>

<p>The mass of strata here shown may be 2000 feet in thickness,
consisting of red and white sandstone, and various coloured shales,
the beds being distinguishable into four principal groups, namely,
No. 1, red marl or shale; No. 2, red sandstone, used for building;
No. 3, conglomerate; and No. 4, grey paving-stone, and tile-stone,
with green and reddish shale, containing peculiar organic remains.
A glance at the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 75">[ 75 ]</a></p>

<p>section will show that each of the formations 2, 3, 4 are
repeated thrice at the surface, twice with a southerly, and once
with a northerly inclination or <i>dip</i>, and the beds in No. 1,
which are nearly horizontal, are still brought up twice by a slight
curvature to the surface, once on each side of A. Beginning at the
north-west extremity, the tile-stones and conglomerates, No. 4 and
No. 3, are vertical, and they generally form a ridge parallel to
the southern skirts of the Grampians. The superior strata, Nos. 2
and 1, become less and less inclined on descending to the valley of
Strathmore, where the strata, having a concave bend, are said by
geologists to lie in a &ldquo; trough" or &ldquo; basin." Through the centre of
this valley runs an imaginary line A, called technically a
&ldquo; synclinal line," where the beds, which are tilted in opposite
directions, may be supposed to meet. It is most important for the
observer to mark such lines, for he will perceive by the diagram
that, in travelling from the north to the centre of the basin, he
is always passing from older to newer beds; whereas, after crossing
the line A, and pursuing his course in the same southerly
direction, he is continually leaving the newer, and advancing upon
older strata. All the deposits which he had before examined begin
then to recur in reversed order, until he arrives at the central
axis of the Sidlaw hills, where the strata are seen to form an
arch, or <i>saddle</i>, having an <i>anticlinal</i> line, B, in the
centre. On passing this line, and continuing towards the S.E., the
formations 4, 3, and 2, are again repeated, in the same relative
order of superposition, but with a southerly dip. At Whiteness (see
Fig. 55) it will be seen that the inclined strata are covered by a
newer deposit, <i>a</i>, in horizontal beds. These are composed of
red conglomerate and sand, and are newer than any of the groups, 1,
2, 3, 4, before described, and rest <i>unconformably</i> upon
strata of the sandstone group, No. 2.</p>

<p>An example of curved strata, in which the bends or convolutions
of the rock are sharper and far more numerous within an equal
space, has been well described by Sir James Hall.* It occurs near
St. Abb&rsquo;s Head, on the east coast of Scotland, where the rocks
consist principally of a bluish slate, having frequently a
ripple-marked surface. The undulations of the beds reach from the
top to the bottom of cliffs from 200 to 300 feet in height, and
there are sixteen distinct bendings in the course of about six
miles, the curvatures being alternately concave and convex
upward.</p>

<p><b>Folding by Lateral
Movement.</b>&mdash;An experiment was made by Sir James
Hall, with a view of illustrating the manner in</p>

<p class="fnote">* Edin. Trans., vol. vii, pl. 3.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</center>

<p>which such strata, assuming them to have been originally
horizontal, may have been forced into their present position. A set
of layers of clay were placed under a weight, and their opposite
ends pressed towards each other with such force as to cause them to
approach more nearly together. On the removal of the weight, the
layers of clay were found to be curved and folded, so as to bear a
miniature resemblance to the strata in the cliffs. We must,
however, bear in mind that in the natural section or sea-cliff we
only see the foldings imperfectly, one part being invisible beneath
the sea, and the other, or upper portion, being supposed to have
been carried away by <i>denudation</i>, or that action of water
which will be explained in the next chapter. The dark lines in the
plan (Fig. 57) represent what is actually seen of the strata in
the line of cliff alluded to; the fainter lines, that portion which
is concealed beneath the sea-level, as also that which is supposed
to have once existed above the present surface.</p>

"Fig. 57"></center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 77">[ 77 ]</a></p>

<p>We may still more easily illustrate the effects which a lateral
thrust might produce on flexible strata, by placing several pieces
of differently coloured cloths upon a table, and when they are
spread out horizontally, cover them with a book. Then apply other
books to each end, and force them towards each other. The folding
of the cloths (see Fig. 58) will imitate those of the bent strata;
the incumbent book being slightly lifted up, and no longer touching
the two volumes on which it rested before, because it is supported
by the tops of the anticlinal ridges formed by the curved cloths.
In like manner there can be no doubt that the squeezed strata,
although laterally condensed and more closely packed, are yet
elongated and made to rise upward, in a direction perpendicular to
the pressure.</p>

<center><img src="images/fig58.jpg" width="358" height="205" alt=
"Fig. 58"></center>

<p>Whether the analogous flexures in stratified rocks have really
been due to similar sideway movements is a question which we can
not decide by reference to our own observation. Our inability to
explain the nature of the process is, perhaps, not simply owing to
the inaccessibility of the subterranean regions where the
mechanical force is exerted, but to the extreme slowness of the
movement. The changes may sometimes be due to variation in the
temperature of mountain masses of rock causing them, while still
solid, to expand or contract; or melting them, and then again
cooling them and allowing them to crystallise. If such be the case,
we have scarcely more reason to expect to witness the operation of
the process within the limited periods of our scientific
observation than to see the swelling of the roots of a tree, by
which, in the course of years, a wall of solid masonry may be
lifted up, rent or thrown down. In both instances the force may be
irresistible, but though adequate, it need not be visible by us,
provided the time required for its development be very great. The
lateral pressure arising from the unequal expansion of rocks by
heat may cause one mass lying in the same horizontal plane
gradually to occupy</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 78">[ 78 ]</a></p>

<p>a larger space, so as to press upon another rock, which, if
flexible, may be squeezed into a bent and folded form. It will also
appear, when the volcanic and granitic rocks are described, that
some of them have, when melted in the interior of the earth&rsquo;s
crust, been injected forcibly into fissures, and after the
solidification of such intruded matter, other sets of rents,
crossing the first, have been formed and in their turn filled by
melted rock. Such repeated injections imply a stretching, and often
upheaval, of the whole mass.</p>

<p>We also know, especially by the study of regions liable to
earthquakes, that there are causes at work in the interior of the
earth capable of producing a sinking in of the ground, sometimes
very local, but often extending over a wide area. The continuance
of such a downward movement, especially if partial and confined to
linear areas, may produce regular folds in the strata.</p>

<p><b>Creeps in Coal-mines.</b>&mdash;The
&ldquo;creeps,&rdquo; as they are called in coal-mines, afford an excellent
illustration of this fact.--First, it may be stated generally, that
the excavation of coal at a considerable depth causes the mass of
overlying strata to sink down bodily, even when props are left to
support the roof of the mine. &ldquo;In Yorkshire,&rdquo; says Mr. Buddle,
&ldquo;three distinct subsidences were perceptible at the surface, after
the clearing out of three seams of coal below, and innumerable
vertical cracks were caused in the incumbent mass of sandstone and
shale which thus settled down.&rdquo;* The exact amount of depression in
these cases can only be accurately measured where water accumulates
on the surface, or a railway traverses a coal-field.</p>

<p>When a bed of coal is worked out, pillars or rectangular masses
of coal are left at intervals as props to support the roof, and
protect the colliers. Thus in Fig. 59, representing a section at
Wallsend, Newcastle, the galleries which have been excavated are
represented by the white spaces <i>a, b,</i> while the adjoining
dark portions are parts of the original coal seam left as props,
beds of sandy clay or shale constituting the floor of the mine.
When the props have been reduced in size, they are pressed down by
the weight of overlying rocks (no less than 630 feet thick) upon
the shale below, which is thereby squeezed and forced up into the
open spaces.</p>

<p>Now it might have been expected that, instead of the floor
rising up, the ceiling would sink down, and this effect, called a
&ldquo;thrust,&rdquo; does, in fact, take place where the pavement is more
solid than the roof. But it usually happens, in coal-</p>

<p class="fnote">* Proceedings of Geol. Soc., vol. iii, p. 148.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 79">[ 79 ]</a></p>

<p>mines, that the roof is composed of hard shale, or occasionally
of sandstone, more unyielding than the foundation, which often
consists of clay. Even where the argillaceous substrata are hard at
first, they soon become softened and reduced to a plastic state
when exposed to the contact of air and water in the floor of a
mine.</p>

<center><img src="images/fig59.jpg" width="390" height="266" alt=
"Fig. 59: Section of carboniferous strata at Wallsend showing 'creeps'.">
</center>

<p>The first symptom of a &ldquo;creep,&rdquo; says Mr. Buddle, is a slight
curvature at the bottom of each gallery, as at <i>a</i>, Fig. 59:
then the pavement, continuing to rise, begins to open with a
longitudinal crack, as at <i>b</i>; then the points of the
fractured ridge reach the roof, as at <i>c</i>; and, lastly, the
upraised beds close up the whole gallery, and the broken portions
of the ridge are reunited and flattened at the top, exhibiting the
flexure seen at <i>d.</i> Meanwhile the coal in the props has
become crushed and cracked by pressure. It is also found that below
the creeps <i>a, b, c, d,</i> an inferior stratum, called the
&ldquo;metal coal,&rdquo; which is 3 feet thick, has been fractured at the
points <i>e, f, g, h,</i> and has risen, so as to prove that the
upward movement, caused by the working out of the &ldquo;main coal,&rdquo; has
been propagated through a thickness of 54 feet of argillaceous
beds, which intervene between the two coal-seams. This same
displacement has also been traced downward more than 150 feet below
the metal coal, but it grows continually less and less until it
becomes imperceptible.</p>

<p>No part of the process above described is more deserving of our
notice than the slowness with which the change in the arrangement
of the beds is brought about. Days,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 80">[ 80 ]</a></p>

<p>months, or even years, will sometimes elapse between the first
bending of the pavement and the time of its reaching the roof.
Where the movement has been most rapid, the curvature of the beds
is most regular, and the reunion of the fractured ends most
complete; whereas the signs of displacement or violence are
greatest in those creeps which have required months or years for
their entire accomplishment. Hence we may conclude that similar
changes may have been wrought on a larger scale in the earth&rsquo;s
crust by partial and gradual subsidences, especially where the
ground has been undermined throughout long periods of time; and we
must be on our guard against inferring sudden violence, simply
because the distortion of the beds is excessive.</p>

<p>Engineers are familiar with the fact that when they raise the
level of a railway by heaping stone or gravel on a foundation of
marsh, quicksand, or other yielding formation, the new mound often
sinks for a time as fast as they attempt to elevate it; when they
have persevered so as to overcome this difficulty, they frequently
find that some of the adjoining flexible ground has risen up in one
or more parallel arches or folds, showing that the vertical
pressure of the sinking materials has given rise to a lateral
folding movement.</p>

<p>In like manner, in the interior of the earth, the solid parts of
the earth&rsquo;s crust may sometimes, as before mentioned, be made to
expand by heat, or may be pressed by the force of steam against
flexible strata loaded with a great weight of incumbent rocks. In
this case the yielding mass, squeezed, but unable to overcome the
resistance which it meets with in a vertical direction, may be
gradually relieved by lateral folding.</p>

<p><b>Dip and Strike.</b>&mdash;In
describing the manner in which strata depart from their original
horizontality, some technical terms, such as &ldquo;dip&rdquo; and &ldquo;strike,&rdquo;
&ldquo;anticlinal&rdquo; and &ldquo;synclinal&rdquo; line or axis, are used by geologists.
I shall now proceed to explain some of these to the student. If a
stratum or bed of rock, instead of being quite level, be inclined
to one side, it is said to <i>dip</i>; the point of the compass to
which it is inclined is called the <i>point of dip</i>, and the
degree of deviation from a level or horizontal line is called <i>
the amount of dip</i>, or <i>the angle of dip.</i> Thus, in the
annexed diagram (Fig. 60), a series of strata are inclined, and
they dip to the north at an angle of forty-five</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 81">[ 81 ]</a></p>

<p>degrees. The <i>strike</i>, or <i>line of bearing</i>, is the
prolongation or extension of the strata in a direction <i>at right
angles</i> to the dip; and hence it is sometimes called the <i>
direction</i> of the strata. Thus, in the above instance of strata
dipping to the north, their strike must necessarily be east and
west. We have borrowed the word from the German geologists, <i>
streichen</i> signifying to extend, to have a certain direction.
Dip and strike may be aptly illustrated by a row of houses running
east and west, the long ridge of the roof representing the strike
of the stratum of slates, which dip on one side to the north, and
on the other to the south.</p>

<p>A stratum which is horizontal, or quite level in all directions,
has neither dip nor strike.</p>

<p>It is always important for the geologist, who is endeavouring to
comprehend the structure of a country, to learn how the beds dip in
every part of the district; but it requires some practice to avoid
being occasionally deceived, both as to the point of dip and the
amount of it.</p>

<center><img src="images/fig61.jpg" width="333" height="192" alt=
"Fig. 61: Apparent horizontality of inclined strata."></center>

<p>If the upper surface of a hard stony stratum be uncovered,
whether artificially in a quarry, or by waves at the foot of a
cliff, it is easy to determine towards what point of the compass
the slope is steepest, or in what direction water would flow if
poured upon it. This is the true dip. But the edges of highly
inclined strata may give rise to perfectly horizontal lines in the
face of a vertical cliff, if the observer see the strata in the
line of the strike, the dip being inward from the face of the
cliff. If, however, we come to a break in the cliff, which exhibits
a section exactly at right angles to the line of the strike, we are
then able to ascertain the true dip. In the drawing (Fig. 61), we
may suppose a headland, one side of which faces to the north, where
the beds would appear perfectly horizontal to a person in the boat;
while in the other side facing the west, the true dip</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 82">[ 82 ]</a></p>

<p>would be seen by the person on shore to be at an angle of
40&deg;. If, therefore, our observations are confined to a vertical
precipice facing in one direction, we must endeavour to find a
ledge or portion of the plane of one of the beds projecting beyond
the others, in order to ascertain the true dip.</p>

<p>If not provided with a clinometer, a most useful instrument,
when it is of consequence to determine with precision the
inclination of the strata, the observer may measure the angle
within a few degrees by standing exactly opposite to a cliff where
the true dip is exhibited, holding the hands immediately before the
eyes, and placing the fingers of one in a perpendicular, and of the
other in a horizontal position, as in Fig. 62. It is thus easy to
discover whether the lines of the inclined beds bisect the angle of
90&deg;, formed by the meeting of the hands, so as to give an angle
of 45&deg;, or whether it would divide the space into two equal or
unequal portions. You have only to change hands to get the line of
dip on the upper side of the horizontal hand.</p>

<p>It has been already seen, in describing the curved strata on the
east coast of Scotland, in Forfarshire and Berwickshire, that a
series of concave and convex bendings are occasionally repeated
several times. These usually form part of a series of parallel
waves of strata, which are prolonged in the same direction,
throughout a considerable extent of country. Thus, for example, in
the Swiss Jura, that lofty chain of mountains has been proved to
consist of many parallel ridges, with intervening longitudinal
valleys, as in Fig. 63, the ridges being formed by curved
fossiliferous strata,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 83">[ 83 ]</a></p>

<p>of which the nature and dip are occasionally displayed in deep
transverse gorges, called &ldquo;cluses,&rdquo; caused by fractures at right
angles to the direction of the chain.* Now let us suppose these
ridges and parallel valleys to run north and south, we should then
say that the <i>strike</i> of the beds is north and south, and the
<i>dip</i> east and west. Lines drawn along the summits of the
ridges, A, B, would be anticlinal lines, and one following the
bottom of the adjoining valleys a synclinal line.</p>

<p><img src="images/fig64.jpg" width="225" height="144" alt=
"Fig. 64: Ground-plan of the denuded ridge C, Fig. 63. Fig. 65: Transverse section." align="right"></p>

<p><b>Outcrop of Strata.</b>&mdash;It
will be observed that some of these ridges, A, B, are unbroken on
the summit, whereas one of them, C, has been fractured along the
line of strike, and a portion of it carried away by denudation, so
that the ridges of the beds in the formations <i>a, b, c</i> come
out to the day, or, as the miners say, <i>crop out</i>, on the
sides of a valley. The ground-plan of such a denuded ridge as C, as
given in a geological map, may be expressed by the diagram, Fig.
64, and the cross-section of the same by Fig. 65. The line D E,
Fig. 64, is the anticlinal line, on each side of which the dip is
in opposite directions, as expressed by the arrows. The emergence
of strata at the surface is called by miners their <i>outcrop</i>,
or <i>basset.</i></p>

<p>If, instead of being folded into parallel ridges, the beds form
a boss or dome-shaped protuberance, and if we suppose the summit of
the dome carried off, the ground-plan would exhibit the edges of
the strata forming a succession of circles, or ellipses, round a
common centre. These circles are the lines of strike, and the dip
being always at right angles is inclined in the course of the
circuit to every point of the compass, constituting what is termed
a qu&acirc;-qu&acirc;versal dip--that is, turning every way.</p>

<p>There are endless variations in the figures described by the
basset-edges of the strata, according to the different inclination
of the beds, and the mode in which they happen to have been
denuded. One of the simplest rules, with which every geologist
should be acquainted, relates to the V-like form of the beds as
they crop out in an ordinary valley. First, if the strata be
horizontal, the V-like form will be also on a level, and the newest
strata will appear at the greatest heights.</p>

 align="left"> 

<p>Secondly, if the beds be inclined and intersected by a valley
sloping in the same direction, and the dip of the beds be less
steep than the slope of the valley, then the V&rsquo;s, as they are often
termed by miners, will point upward (see Fig. 66), those formed by
the newer beds appearing in a superior position, and extending
highest up the valley, as A is seen above B.</p>

<p>Thirdly, if the dip of the beds be steeper than the slope of the
valley, then the V&rsquo;s will point downward (see Fig. 67), and those
formed of the older beds will now appear uppermost, as B appears
above A.</p>

<p>Fourthly, in every case where the strata dip in a contrary
direction to the slope of the valley, whatever be the angle of
inclination, the newer beds will appear the highest, as in the
first and second cases. This is shown by the drawing (Fig. 68),
which exhibits strata rising at an angle of 20&deg;, and crossed by
a valley, which declines in an opposite direction at 20&deg;.</p>

A miner unacquainted with the rule, who had first explored the

valley, Fig. 67, and discovering there also the outcrop of two
coal-seams, might begin his workings in the uppermost in the
expectation of coming down to the other bed A, which would be
observed cropping out lower down the valley. But a glance at the
section will demonstrate the futility of such hopes.*</p>

<p><b>Synclinal Strata forming
Ridges.</b>&mdash;Although in many cases an anticlinal axis
forms a ridge, and a synclinal axis a valley, as in A B, Fig. 63,
yet this can by no means be laid down as a general rule, as the
beds very often slope inward from either side of a mountain, as at
<i>a, b,</i> Fig. 69, while in the intervening valley, <i>c</i>,
they slope upward, forming an arch.</p>

<p>It would be natural to expect the fracture of solid rocks to
take place chiefly where the bending of the strata has been
sharpest, and such rending may produce ravines giving access to
running water and exposing the surface to atmospheric waste. The
entire absence, however, of such cracks at points where the strain
must have been greatest, as at <i>a</i>, Fig. 63, is often very
remarkable, and not always easy of explanation. We must imagine
that many strata of limestone, chert, and other rocks which are now
brittle, were pliant when bent into their present position. They
may have owed their flexibility in part to the fluid matter which
they contained in their minute pores, as before described <a href=
"ch4.html#page 62">p. 62</a> and in part to the permeation of
sea-water while they were yet submerged.</p>

<p>At the western extremity of the Pyrenees, great curvatures of
the strata are seen in the sea-cliffs, where the rocks consist of
marl, grit, and chert. At certain points, as at <i>a</i>, Fig. 70,
some of the bendings of the flinty chert are so sharp that
specimens might be broken off well fitted to serve as ridge-tiles
on the roof of a house. Although this chert could not have been
brittle as now, when first folded into this shape, it presents,
nevertheless, here and there, at the points of greatest flexure,
small cracks, which show that it was solid, and not wholly
incapable of breaking at the period of its displacement. The
numerous rents alluded to are not empty, but filled with chalcedony
and quartz.</p>

<p>Between San Caterina and Castrogiovanni, in Sicily, bent and
undulating gypseous marls occur, with here and there thin beds of
solid gypsum interstratified. Sometimes these solid layers have
been broken into detached fragments, still preserving their sharp
edges (<i>g, g,</i> Fig. 71), while the continuity of the more
pliable and ductile marls, <i>m, m,</i> has not been
interrupted.</p>

"Fig. 72: Folded strata." align="right"> 

<p>We have already explained, Fig. 69, that stratified rocks have
usually their strata bent into parallel folds forming anticlinal
and synclinal axes, a group of several of these folds having often
been subjected to a common movement, and having acquired a uniform
strike or direction. In some disturbed regions these folds have
been doubled back upon themselves in such a manner that it is often
difficult for an experienced geologist to determine correctly the
relative age of the beds by superposition. Thus, if we meet with
the strata seen in the section, Fig. 72, we should naturally
suppose that there were twelve distinct beds, or sets of beds, No.
1 being the newest, and No. 12 the oldest of the series. But this
section may perhaps exhibit merely six</p>

<p>beds, which have been folded in the manner seen in Fig. 73, so
that each of them is twice repeated, the position of one half being
reversed, and part of No. 1, originally the uppermost, having now
become the lowest of the series.</p>

<p>These phenomena are observable on a magnificent scale in certain
regions in Switzerland, in precipices often more than 2000 feet in
perpendicular height, and there are flexures not inferior in
dimensions in the Pyrenees. The upper part of the curves seen in
this diagram, Fig. 73, and expressed in fainter lines, has been
removed by what is called denudation, to be afterwards
explained.</p>

<p><b>Fractures of the Strata and
Faults.</b>&mdash;Numerous rents may often be seen in rocks
which appear to have been simply broken, the fractured parts still
remaining in contact; but we often find a fissure, several inches
or yards wide, intervening between the disunited portions. These
fissures are usually filled with fine earth and sand, or with
angular fragments of stone, evidently derived from the fracture of
the contiguous rocks.</p>

<p>The face of each wall of the fissure is often beautifully
polished, as if glazed, striated, or scored with parallel furrows
and ridges, such as would be produced by the continued rubbing
together of surfaces of unequal hardness. These polished surfaces
are called by miners &ldquo;slickensides.&rdquo; It is supposed that the lines
of the stri&aelig; indicate the direction in which the rocks were
moved. During one of the minor earthquakes in Chili, in 1840, the
brick walls of a building were rent vertically in several places,
and made to vibrate for several minutes during each shock, after
which they remained uninjured, and without any opening, although
the line of each crack was still visible. When all movement had
ceased, there were seen on the floor of the house, at the bottom of
each rent, small heaps of fine brick-dust, evidently produced by
trituration.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon to find the mass of rock on one side of a
fissure thrown up above or down below the mass with which it was
once in contact on the other side. &ldquo;This mode of displacement is
called a fault, shift, slip, or throw.&rdquo; &ldquo;The miner,&rdquo; says Playfair,
describing a fault, &ldquo;is often perplexed,</p>

which changes at once all those lines and bearings which had
hitherto directed his course. When his mine reaches a certain
plane, which is sometimes perpendicular, as in A B, Fig. 74,
sometimes oblique to the horizon (as in C D, ibid.), he finds the
beds of rock broken asunder, those on the one side of the plane
having changed their place, by sliding in a particular direction
along the face of the others. In this motion they have sometimes
preserved their parallelism, as in Fig. 74, so that the strata on
each side of faults A B, C D, continue parallel to one another; in
other cases, the strata on each side are inclined, as in <i>a, b,
c, d</i> (Fig. 75), though their identity is still to be recognised
by their possessing the same thickness and the same internal
characters.&rdquo;*</p>

<p>In Coalbrook Dale, says Mr. Prestwich&dagger;, deposits of
sandstone, shale, and coal, several thousand feet thick, and
occupying an area of many miles, have been shivered into fragments,
and the broken remnants have been placed in very discordant
positions, often at levels differing several hundred feet from each
other. The sides of the faults, when perpendicular, are commonly
several yards apart, and are sometimes as much as 50 yards asunder,
the interval being filled with broken <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of the
strata. In following the</p>

<p>course of the same fault it is sometimes found to produce in
different places very unequal changes of level, the amount of shift
being in one place 300, and in another 700 feet, which arises from
the union of two or more faults. In other words, the disjointed
strata have in certain districts been subjected to renewed
movements, which they have not suffered elsewhere.</p>

<p>We may occasionally see exact counterparts of these slips, on a
small scale, in pits of loose sand and gravel, many of which have
doubtless been caused by the drying and shrinking of argillaceous
and other beds, slight subsidences having taken place from failure
of support. Sometimes, however, even these small slips may have
been produced during earthquakes; for land has been moved, and its
level, relatively to the sea, considerably altered, within the
period when much of the alluvial sand and gravel now covering the
surface of continents was deposited.</p>

<p>I have already stated that a geologist must be on his guard, in
a region of disturbed strata, against inferring repeated
alternations of rocks, when, in fact, the same strata, once
continuous, have been bent round so as to recur in the same
section, and with the same dip. A similar mistake has often been
occasioned by a series of faults.</p>

<center><img src="images/fig76.jpg" width="329" height="200" alt=
"Fig. 76: Apparent alternations of strata caused by vertical faults.">
</center>

<p>If, for example, the dark line A H (Fig. 76) represent the
surface of a country on which the strata <i>a, b, c</i> frequently
crop out, an observer who is proceeding from H to A might at first
imagine that at every step he was approaching new strata, whereas
the repetition of the same beds has been caused by vertical faults,
or downthrows. Thus, suppose the original mass, A, B, C, D, to have
been a set of uniformly inclined strata, and that the different
masses under E F, F G, and G D sank down successively, so as to
leave vacant</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 90">[ 90 ]</a></p>

<p>the spaces marked in the diagram by dotted lines, and to occupy
those marked by the continuous lines, then let denudation take
place along the line A H, so that the protruding masses indicated
by the fainter lines are swept away--a miner, who has not
discovered the faults, finding the mass <i>a</i>, which we will suppose to
be a bed of coal four times repeated, might hope to find four beds,
workable to an indefinite depth, but first, on arriving at the
fault G, he is stopped suddenly in his workings, for he comes
partly upon the shale <i>b</i>, and partly on the sandstone <i>
c</i>; the same result awaits him at the fault F, and on reaching E
he is again stopped by a wall composed of the rock <i>d.</i></p>

<p>The very different levels at which the separated parts of the
same strata are found on the different sides of the fissure, in
some faults, is truly astonishing. One of the most celebrated in
England is that called the &ldquo;ninety-fathom dike,&rdquo; in the coal-field
of Newcastle. This name has been given to it, because the same beds
are ninety fathoms (540 feet) lower on the northern than they are
on the southern side. The fissure has been filled by a body of
sand, which is now in the state of sandstone, and is called the
dike, which is sometimes very narrow, but in other places more than
twenty yards wide.* The walls of the fissure are scored by grooves,
such as would have been produced if the broken ends of the rock had
been rubbed along the plane of the fault.&dagger; In the Tynedale
and Craven faults, in the north of England, the vertical
displacement is still greater, and the fracture has extended in a
horizontal direction for a distance of thirty miles or more.</p>

<p><b>Great Faults the Result of Repeated
Movements.</b>&mdash;It must not, however, be supposed that
faults generally consist of single linear rents; there are usually
a number of faults springing off from the main one, and sometimes a
long strip of country seems broken up into fragments by sets of
parallel and connecting transverse faults. Oftentimes a great line
of fault has been repeated, or the movements have been continued
through successive periods, so that, newer deposits having covered
the old line of displacement, the strata both newer and older have
given way along the old line of fracture. Some geologists have
considered it necessary to imagine that the upward or downward
movement in these cases was accomplished at a single stroke, and
not by a series of sudden but interrupted movements. They appear to
have derived this idea from a notion that the grooved walls</p>

<p>have merely been rubbed in one direction, which is far from
being a constant phenomenon. Not only are some sets of stri&aelig;
not parallel to others, but the clay and rubbish between the walls,
when squeezed or rubbed, have been streaked in different
directions, the grooves which the harder minerals have impressed on
the softer being frequently curved and irregular.</p>

"Fig. 77: Faults and denuded coal-strata, Ashby de la Zouch.">
</center>

<p>The usual absence of protruding masses of rock forming
precipices or ridges along the lines of great faults has already
been alluded to in explaining Fig. 76, p. 89, and the same
remarkable fact is well exemplified in every coal-field which has
been extensively worked. It is in such districts that the former
relation of the beds which have been shifted is determinable with
great accuracy. Thus in the coal-field of Ashby de la Zouch, in
Leicestershire (see Fig. 77), a fault occurs, on one side of which
the coal-beds <i>a, b, c, d</i> must once have risen to the height
of 500 feet above the corresponding beds on the other side. But the
uplifted strata do not stand up 500 feet above the general surface;
on the contrary, the outline of the country, as expressed by the
line <i>z z</i>, is uniformly undulating, without any break, and
the mass indicated by the dotted outline must have been washed
away.*</p>

<p>The student may refer to Mr. Hull&rsquo;s measurement of faults,
observed in the Lancashire coal-field, where the vertical
displacement has amounted to thousands of feet, and yet where all
the superficial inequalities which must have resulted from such
movements have been obliterated by subsequent denudation. In the
same memoir proofs are afforded of there having been two periods of
vertical movement in the same fault--one, for example, before, and
another after, the Triassic epoch.&dagger;</p>

<p>The shifting of the beds by faults is often intimately connected
with those same foldings which constitute the anti-</p>

<p>clinal and synclinal axes before alluded to, and there is no
doubt that the subterranean causes of both forms of disturbance are
to a great extent the same. A fault in Virginia, believed to imply
a displacement of several thousand feet, has been traced for more
than eighty miles in the same direction as the foldings of the
Appalachian chain.* An hypothesis which attributes such a change of
position to a succession of movements, is far preferable to any
theory which assumes each fault to have been accomplished by a
single upcast or downthrow of several thousand feet. For we know
that there are operations now in progress, at great depths in the
interior of the earth, by which both large and small tracts of
ground are made to rise above and sink below their former level,
some slowly and insensibly, others suddenly and by starts, a few
feet or yards at a time; whereas there are no grounds for believing
that, during the last 3000 years at least, any regions have been
either upheaved or depressed, at a single stroke, to the amount of
several hundred, much less several thousand feet.</p>

<p>It is certainly not easy to understand how in the subterranean
regions one mass of solid rock should have been folded up by a
continued series of movements, while another mass in contact, or
only separated by a line of fissure, has remained stationary or has
perhaps subsided. But every volcano, by the intermittent action of
the steam, gases, and lava evolved during an eruption, helps us to
form some idea of the manner in which such operations take place.
For eruptions are repeated at uncertain intervals throughout the
whole or a large part of a geological period, some of the
surrounding and contiguous districts remaining quite undisturbed.
And in most of the instances with which we are best acquainted the
emission of lava, scoria, and steam is accompanied by the uplifting
of the solid crust. Thus in Vesuvius, Etna, the Madeiras, the
Canary Islands, and the Azores there is evidence of marine deposits
of recent and tertiary date having been elevated to the height of a
thousand feet, and sometimes more, since the commencement of the
volcanic explosions. There is, moreover, a general tendency in
contemporaneous volcanic vents to affect a linear arrangement,
extending in some instances, as in the Andes or the Indian
Archipelago, to distances equalling half the circumference of the
globe. Where volcanic heat, therefore, operates at such a depth as
not to obtain vent at the surface, in the form of an eruption, it
may nevertheless be conceived to give rise to upheavals, foldings,
and faults in</p>

<p>certain linear tracts. And marine denudation, to be treated of
in the next chapter, will help us to understand why that which
should be the protruding portion of the faulted rocks is missing at
the surface.</p>

<p><b>Arrangement and Direction of Parallel
Folds of Strata.</b>&mdash;The possible causes of the
folding of strata by lateral movements have been considered in a
former part of this chapter. No European chain of mountains affords
so remarkable an illustration of the persistency of such flexures
for a great distance as the Appalachians before alluded to, and
none has been studied and described by many good observers with
more accuracy. The chain extends from north to south, or rather
N.N.E. to S.S.W., for nearly 1500 miles, with a breadth of 50
miles, throughout which the Pal&aelig;ozoic strata have been so
bent as to form a series of parallel anticlinal and synclinal
ridges and troughs, comprising usually three or four principal and
many smaller plications, some of them forming broad and gentle
arches, others narrower and steeper ones, while some, where the
bending has been greatest, have the position of their beds
inverted, as before shown in Fig. 73, p. 87.</p>

<p>The strike of the parallel ridges, after continuing in a
straight line for many hundred miles, is then found to vary for a
more limited distance as much as 30&deg;, the folds wheeling round
together in the new direction and continuing to be parallel, as if
they had all obeyed the same movement. The date of the movements by
which the great flexures were brought about must, of course, be
subsequent to the formation of the uppermost part of the coal or
the newest of the bent rocks, but the disturbance must have ceased
before the Triassic strata were deposited on the denuded edges of
the folded beds.</p>

<p>The manner in which the numerous parallel folds, all
simultaneously formed, assume a new direction common to the whole
of them, and sometimes varying at an angle of 30&deg; from the
normal strike of the chain, shows what deviation from an otherwise
uniform strike of the beds may be experienced when the geographical
area through which they are traced is on so vast a scale.</p>

<p>The disturbances in the case here adverted to occurred between
the Carboniferous period and that of the Trias, and this interval
is so vast that they may have occupied a great lapse of time,
during which their parallelism was always preserved. But, as a
rule, wherever after a long geological interval the recurrence of
lateral movements gives rise to a new set of folds, the strike of
these last is different. Thus,</p>

<p>for example, Mr. Hull has pointed out that three principal lines
of disturbance, all later than the Carboniferous period, have
affected the stratified rocks of Lancashire. The first of these,
having an E.N.E. direction, took place at the close of the
Carboniferous period. The next, running north and south, at the
close of the Permian, and the third, having a N.N.W. direction, at
the close of the Jurassic period.*</p>

<p><b>Unconformability of
Strata.</b>&mdash; Strata are said to be unconformable when
one series is so placed over another that the planes of the
superior repose on the edges of the inferior (see Fig. 78). In this
case it is evident that a period had elapsed between the production
of the two sets of strata, and that, during this interval, the
older series had been tilted and disturbed. Afterwards the upper
series was thrown down in horizontal strata upon it. If these
superior beds, <i>d, d,</i> Fig. 78, are also inclined, it is plain
that the lower strata <i>a, a,</i> have been twice displaced;
first, before the deposition of the newer beds, <i>d, d,</i> and a
second time when these same strata were upraised out of the sea,
and thrown slightly out of the horizontal position.</p>

<p>It often happens that in the interval between the deposition of
two sets of unconformable strata, the inferior rock has not only
been denuded, but drilled by perforating shells. Thus, for example,
at Autreppe and Gusigny, near Mons, beds of an ancient (primary or
pal&aelig;ozoic) limestone, highly inclined, and often bent, are
covered with horizontal strata</p>

<p>of greenish and whitish marls of the Cretaceous formation. The
lowest, and therefore the oldest, bed of the horizontal series is
usually the sand and conglomerate, <i>a</i>, in which are rounded
fragments of stone, from an inch to two feet in diameter. These
fragments have often adhering shells attached to them, and have
been bored by perforating mollusca. The solid surface of the
inferior limestone has also been bored, so as to exhibit
cylindrical and pear-shaped cavities, as at <i>c</i>, the work of
saxicavous mollusca; and many rents, as at <i>b</i>, which descend
several feet or yards into the limestone, have been filled with
sand and shells, similar to those in the stratum <i>a.</i></p>

<p><b>Overlapping
Strata.</b>&mdash;Strata are said to overlap when an upper
bed extends beyond the limits of a lower one. This may be produced
in various ways; as, for example, when alterations of physical
geography cause the arms of a river or channels of discharge to
vary, so that sediment brought down is deposited over a wider area
than before, or when the sea-bottom has been raised up and again
depressed without disturbing the horizontal position of the strata.
In this case the newer strata may rest for the most part
conformably on the older, but, extending farther, pass over their
edges. Every intermediate state between unconformable and
over-lapping beds may occur, because there may be every gradation
between a slight derangement of position, and a considerable
disturbance and denudation of the older formation before the newer
beds come on.</p>
