<p>In Western France, the Alps, the Carpathians, Northern Italy,
and the Apennines, an extensive series of rocks has been described
by Continental geologists under the name of Tithonian. These beds,
which are without any marine equivalent in this country, appear
completely to bridge over the interval between the Neocomian and
the Oolites. They may, perhaps, as suggested by Mr. Judd, be of the
same age as part of the Wealden series.</p>

<p><b>Folkstone and Hythe Beds.</b>&mdash;The sands which crop out
beneath the Gault in Wiltshire, Surrey, and Sussex are sometimes in
the uppermost part pure white, at others of a yellow and
ferruginous colour, and some of the beds contain much green matter.
At Folkestone they contain layers of calcareous matter and chert,
and at Hythe, in the neighbourhood, as also at Maidstone and other
parts of Kent, the limestone called Kentish Rag is intercalated.
This somewhat clayey</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 309">[ 309 ]</a></p>

<p>and calcareous stone forms strata two feet thick, alternating
with quartzose sand. The total thickness of these Folkestone and
Hythe beds is less than 300 feet, and they are seen to rest
immediately on a grey clay, to which we shall presently allude as
the Atherfield clay. Among the fossils of the Folkestone and Hythe
beds we may mention <i>Nautilus plicatus</i> (Fig. 277), <i>
Ancyloceras (Scaphites) gigas</i> (Fig. 278), which has been aptly
described as an Ammonite more or less uncoiled; <i>Trigonia
caudata</i> (Fig. 280), <i>Gervillia anceps</i> (Fig. 279), a
bivalve genus allied to Avicula, and <i>Terebratula sella</i> (<a
href="images2/fig281.jpg">Fig. 281</a>). In ferruginous beds of the
same age in Wiltshire is found a remarkable shell called <i>Diceras
Lonsdalii</i> (<a href="images2/fig281.jpg">Fig. 282</a>), which
abounds in the Upper and Middle Neocomian of Southern Europe. This
genus is closely allied to Chama, and the cast of the interior has
been compared to the horns of a goat.</p>

</center>

<p><b>Atherfield Clay.</b>&mdash;We mentioned before that the
Folkstone and Hythe series rest on a grey clay. This clay is only
of slight thickness in Kent and Surrey, but acquires great
dimensions at Atherfield, in the Isle of Wight. The difference,
indeed, in mineral character and thickness of the Upper Neocomian
formation near Folkestone, and the corresponding beds in the south
of the Isle of Wight, about</p>

</center>

<p>100 miles distant, is truly remarkable. In the latter place we
find no limestone answering to the Kentish Rag, and the entire
thickness from the bottom of the Atherfield clay to the top of the
Neocomian, instead of being less than 300 feet as in Kent, is given
by the late Professor E. Forbes as 843 feet, which he divides into
sixty-three strata, forming three groups. The uppermost of these
consists of ferruginous sands, the second of sands and clay, and
the third or lowest of a brown clay, abounding in fossils.</p>

<p>Pebbles of quartzose sandstone, jasper, and flinty slate,
together with grains of chlorite and mica, and, as Mr.
Godwin-Austen has shown, fragments and water-worn fossils of the
oolitic rocks, speak plainly of the nature of the pre-existing
formations, by the wearing down of which the Neocomian beds were
formed. The land, consisting of such rocks, was doubtless submerged
before the origin of the white chalk, a deposit which was formed in
a more open sea, and in clearer waters.</p>

<img src="images2/fig283.jpg" width="234" height="206" alt=
"Fig. 283: Perna mulleti." align="left"> 

<p>Among the shells of the Atherfield clay the biggest and most
abundant shell is the large <i>Perna Mulleti,</i> of which a
reduced figure is given in Fig. 283.</p>

<p><i>Similarity of Conditions causing Reappearance of
Species.</i>&mdash;Some species of mollusca and other fossils range
through the whole series, while others are confined to particular
subdivisions, and Forbes laid down a law which has since been found
of very general application in regard to estimating the
chronological relations of consecutive</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 311">[ 311 ]</a></p>

<p>strata. Whenever similar conditions, he says, are repeated, the
same species reappear, provided too great a lapse of time has not
intervened; whereas if the length of the interval has been
geologically great, the same genera will reappear represented by
distinct species. Changes of depth, or of the mineral nature of the
sea-bottom, the presence or absence of lime or of peroxide of iron,
the occurrence of a muddy, or a sandy, or a gravelly bottom, are
marked by the banishment of certain species and the predominance of
others. But these differences of conditions being mineral,
chemical, and local in their nature, have no necessary connection
with the extinction, throughout a large area, of certain animals or
plants. When the forms proper to loose sand or soft clay, or to
perfectly clear water, or to a sea of moderate or great depth,
recur with all the same species, we may infer that the interval of
time has been, geologically speaking, small, however dense the mass
of matter accumulated. But if, the genera remaining the same, the
species are changed, we have entered upon a new period; and no
similarity of climate, or of geographical and local conditions, can
then recall the old species which a long series of destructive
causes in the animate and inanimate world has gradually
annihilated.</p>

<p><b>Speeton Clay, Upper Division.</b>&mdash;On the coast, beneath
the white chalk of Flamborough Head, in Yorkshire, an argillaceous
formation crops out, called the Speeton clay, several hundred feet
in thickness, the pal&aelig;ontological relations of which have
been ably worked out by Mr. John W. Judd,* and he has shown that it
is separable into three divisions, the uppermost of which, 150 feet
thick, and containing 87 species of mollusca, decidedly belongs to
the Atherfield clay and associated strata of Hythe and Folkestone,
already described. It is characterised by the <i>Perna Mulleti</i>
(<a href="images2/fig283.jpg">Fig. 283</a>) and <i>Terebratula
sella</i> (<a href="images2/fig281.jpg">Fig. 281</a>), and by <i>
Ammonites Deshayesii</i> (Fig. 284), a well-known Hythe fossil.
Fine skeletons of reptiles of the genera Pliosaurus and Teleosaurus
have been obtained from this clay. At the base of this upper
division of the Speeton clay there occurs a layer of large
Septaria, formerly worked for the manufacture of cement. This bed
is crowded with fossils, especially Ammonites, one species of
which, three feet in diameter, was observed by Mr. Judd.</p>

<p><b>Tealby Series.</b>&mdash;At Tealby, a village in the
Lincolnshire Wolds, there crop out beneath the white chalk some
non-fossiliferous ferruginous sands about twenty-feet thick,
beneath which are beds of clay and limestone, about fifty feet
thick, with an interesting suite of fossils, among which are <i>
Pecten cinctus</i> (Fig. 285), from 9 to 12 inches in diameter, <i>
Ancyloceras Duvallei</i> (Fig. 286), and some forty other shells,
many of them common to the Middle Speeton clay, about to be
mentioned. Mr. Judd remarks that as <i>Ammonites clypeiformis</i>
and <i>Terebratula hippopus</i> characterise the Middle Neocomian
of the Continent, it is to this stage that the Tealby series
containing the same fossils may be assigned.*</p>

</center>

<p>The middle division of the Speeton clay, occurring at Speeton
below the cement-bed, before alluded to, is 150 feet thick, and
contains about 39 species of mollusca, half of which are common to
the overlying clay. Among the peculiar shells, <i>Pecten
cinctus</i> (Fig. 285) and <i>Ancyloceras (Crioceras) Duvallei</i>
(Fig. 286) occur.</p>

<p>In the lower division of the Speeton clay, 200 feet thick, 46
species of mollusca have been found, and three divisions, each
characterised by its peculiar ammonite, have been noticed by Mr.
Judd. The central zone is marked by <i>Ammonites Noricus</i> (see
Fig. 287). On the Continent these beds are well-known by their
corresponding fossils, the Hils clay and conglomerate of the north
of Germany agreeing with</p>

<p>the Middle and Lower Speeton, the latter of which, with the same
mineral characters and fossils as in Yorkshire, is also found in
the little island of Heligoland. Yellow limestone, which I have
myself seen near Neuchatel, in Switzerland, represents the Lower
Neocomian at Speeton.</p>

<br>
<center><small>WEALDEN FORMATION.</small></center>

<p>Beneath the Atherfield clay or Upper Neocomian of the S.E. of
England, a fresh-water formation is found, called the Wealden,
which, although it occupies a small horizontal area in Europe, as
compared to the White Chalk and the marine Neocomian beds, is
nevertheless of great geological interest, since the imbedded
remains give us some insight into the nature of the terrestrial
fauna and flora of the Lower Cretaceous epoch. The name of Wealden
was given to this group because it was first studied in parts of
Kent, Surrey, and Sussex, called the Weald; and we are indebted to
Dr. Mantell for having shown, in 1822, in his &ldquo;Geology of
Sussex,&rdquo; that the whole group was of fluviatile origin. In
proof of this he called attention to the entire absence of
Ammonites, Belemnites, Brachiopoda, Echinodermata, Corals, and
other marine fossils, so characteristic of the Cretaceous rocks
above, and of the Oolitic strata below, and to the presence in the
Weald of Paludin&aelig;, Melani&aelig;, Cyren&aelig;, and various
fluviatile shells, as well as the bones of terrestrial reptiles and
the trunks and leaves of land-plants.</p>

<p>The evidence of so unexpected a fact as that of a dense mass of
purely fresh-water origin underlying a deep-sea deposit (a
phenomenon with which we have since become familiar) was received,
at first, with no small doubt and incredulity. But the relative
position of the beds is unequivocal; the Weald Clay being
distinctly seen to pass beneath the Atherfield Clay in various
parts of Surrey, Kent, and Sussex, and to reappear in the Isle of
Wight at the base of the Cretaceous series, being, no doubt,
continuous far beneath the surface, as indicated by the dotted
lines in <a href="images2/fig288.jpg">Fig. 288.</a> They are also
found occupying the same relative position below the chalk in the
peninsula of Purbeck, Dorsetshire, where, as we shall see in the
sequel, they repose on strata referable to the Upper Oolite.</p>

<p><i>Weald Clay.</i>&mdash;The Upper division, or Weald Clay, is,
in great part, of fresh-water origin, but in its highest
portion</p>

<center><img src="images2/fig288.jpg" width="410" height="159" alt=

<p>contains beds of oysters and other marine shells which indicate
fluvio-marine conditions. The uppermost beds are not only
conformable, as Dr. Fitton observes, to the inferior strata of the
overlying Neocomian, but of similar mineral composition. To explain
this, we may suppose that, as the delta of a great river was
tranquilly subsiding, so as to allow the sea to encroach upon the
space previously occupied by fresh-water, the river still continued
to carry down the same sediment into the sea. In confirmation of
this view it may be stated that the remains of the <i>Iguanodon
Mantelli,</i> a gigantic terrestrial reptile, very characteristic
of the Wealden, has been discovered near Maidstone, in the
overlying Kentish Rag, or marine limestone of the Upper Neocomian.
Hence we may infer that some of the saurians which inhabited the
country of the great river continued to live when part of the
district had become submerged beneath the sea. Thus, in our own
times, we may suppose the bones of large alligators to be
frequently entombed in recent fresh-water strata in the delta of
the Ganges. But if part of that delta should sink down so as to be
covered by the sea, marine formations might begin to accumulate in
the same space where fresh-water beds had previously been formed;
and yet the Ganges might still pour down its turbid waters in the
same direction, and carry seaward the carcasses of the same species
of alligator, in which case their bones might be included in marine
as well as in subjacent fresh-water strata.</p>

<p>The Iguanodon, first discovered by Dr. Mantell, was an
herbivorous reptile, of which the teeth, though bearing a great
analogy, in their general form and crenated edges (see <a href=
"images2/fig289.jpg">Figs. 289</a> <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>), to the
modern Iguanas which now frequent the tropical woods of America and
the West Indies, exhibit many important differences. It appears
that they have often been worn by the process of mastication;
whereas the existing herbivorous reptiles clip and gnaw off the
vegetable productions on which they feed, but do not chew them.
Their teeth frequently present an appearance</p>

<p>of having been chipped off, but never, like the fossil teeth of
the Iguanodon, have a flat ground surface (see Fig. 290, <i>b</i>)
resembling the grinders of herbivorous mammalia. Dr. Mantell
computes that the teeth and bones of this species which passed
under his examination during twenty years must have belonged to no
less than seventy-one distinct individuals, varying in age and
magnitude from the reptile just burst from the egg, to one of which
the femur measured twenty-four inches in circumference. Yet,
notwithstanding that the teeth were more numerous than any other
bones, it is remarkable that it was not until the relics of all
these individuals had been found, that a solitary example of part
of a jaw-bone was obtained. Soon afterwards remains both of the
upper and lower jaw were met with in the Hastings beds in Tilgate
Forest, near Cuckfield. In the same sands at Hastings, Mr. Beckles
found large tridactyle impressions which it is conjectured were
made by the hind feet of this animal, on which it is ascertained
that there were only three well-developed toes.</p>

<p>Occasionally bands of limestone, called Sussex Marble, occur in
the Weald Clay, almost entirely composed of a species of <i>
Paludina,</i> closely resembling the common <i>P. vivipara</i> of
English rivers. Shells of the <i>Cypris,</i> a genus of Crustaceans
mentioned (<a href="ch3.html#page 57">p. 57</a>) as abounding in
lakes and ponds, are also plentifully scattered through the clays
of the Wealden,</p>

<p>The picturesque scenery of the &ldquo;High Rocks&rdquo; and
other places in the neighbourhood of Tunbridge Wells is caused by
the steep natural cliffs, to which a hard bed of white sand,
occurring in the upper part of the Tunbridge Wells Sand, mentioned
in the above table, gives rise. This bed of &ldquo;rock-sand&rdquo;
varies in thickness from 25 to 48 feet. Large masses of it, which
were by no means hard or capable of making a good building-stone,
form, nevertheless, projecting rocks with perpendicular faces, and
resist the degrading action of the river because, says Mr. Drew,
they present a solid mass without planes of division. The
calcareous sandstone and grit of Tilgate Forest, near Cuckfield, in
which the remains of the Iguanodon and Hyl&aelig;osaurus were first
found by Dr. Mantell, constitute an upper member of the Tunbridge
Wells Sand, while the &ldquo;sand-rock&rdquo; of the Hastings
cliffs, about 100 feet thick, is one of the lower members of the
same. The reptiles, which are very abundant in this division,
consist partly of saurians, referred by Owen and Mantell to eight
genera, among which, besides those already enumerated, we find the
Megalosaurus and Plesiosaurus. The Pterodactyl also, a flying
reptile, is met with in the same strata, and many remains of
Chelonians of the genera <i>Trionyx</i> and <i>Emys,</i> now
confined to tropical regions.</p>

<p>The fishes of the Wealden are chiefly referable to the Ganoid
and Placoid orders. Among them the teeth and scales of <i>
Lepidotus</i> are most widely diffused (see Fig. 293, next page).
These</p>

<p>ganoids were allied to the <i>Lepidosteus,</i> or Gar-pike, of
the American rivers. The whole body was covered with large
rhomboidal scales, very thick, and having the exposed part coated
with enamel. Most of the species of this genus are supposed to have
been either river-fish, or inhabitants of the sea at the mouth of
estuaries.</p>

<p>At different heights in the Hastings Sands, we find again and
again slabs of sandstone with a strong ripple-mark, and between
these slabs beds of clay many yards thick. In some places, as at
Stammerham, Horsham, near there, are indications of this clay
having been exposed so as to dry and crack before the next layer
was thrown down upon it. The open cracks in the clay have served as
moulds, of which casts have been taken in relief, and which are,
therefore, seen on the lower surface of the sandstone (see Fig.
295).</p>

<p>Near the same place a reddish sandstone occurs in which</p>

<p>are innumerable traces of a fossil vegetable, apparently <i>
Sphenopteris,</i> the stems and branches of which are disposed as
if the plants were standing erect on the spot where they originally
grew, the sand having been gently deposited upon and around them;
and similar appearances have been remarked in other places in this
formation.* In the same division also of the Wealden, at Cuckfield,
is a bed of gravel or conglomerate, consisting of water-worn
pebbles of quartz and jasper, with rolled bones of reptiles. These
must have been drifted by a current, probably in water of no great
depth.</p>

<p>From such facts we may infer that, notwithstanding the great
thickness of this division of the Wealden, the whole of it was a
deposit in water of a moderate depth, and often extremely shallow.
This idea may seem startling at first, yet such would be the
natural consequence of a gradual and continuous sinking of the
ground in an estuary or bay, into which a great river discharged
its turbid waters. By each foot of subsidence, the fundamental rock
would be depressed one foot farther from the surface; but the bay
would not be deepened, if newly-deposited mud and sand should raise
the bottom one foot. On the contrary, such new strata of sand and
mud might be frequently laid dry at low water, or overgrown for a
season by a vegetation proper to marshes.</p>

<p><b>Punfield Beds, Brackish and Marine.</b>&mdash;The shells of
the Wealden beds belong to the genera <i>Melanopsis, Melania,
Paludina, Cyrena, Cyclas, Unio</i> (see <a href=
"images2/fig294.jpg">Fig. 294</a>), and others, which inhabit
rivers or lakes; but one band has been found at Punfield, in
Dorsetshire, indicating a brackish state of the water, where the
genera <i>Corbula, Mytilus,</i> and <i>Ostrea</i> occur; and in
some places this bed becomes purely marine, containing some
well-known Neocomian fossils, among which <i>Ammonites
Deshayesii</i> (<a href="images2/fig284.jpg">Fig. 284</a>) may be
mentioned. Others are peculiar as British, but very characteristic
of the Upper and Middle Neocomian of Spain, and among these the <i>
Vicarya Lujani</i> (<a href="images2/fig297.jpg">Fig. 297</a>), a
shell allied to Nerinea, is conspicuous.</p>

<p>Wealden beds are given as the fresh-water equivalents of the
Marine Neocomian. The highest part of them in England may, for
reasons just given, be regarded as Upper Neocomian, while some of
the inferior portions may correspond in age to the Middle and Lower
divisions of that group. In favour of this latter view, M. Marcou
mentions that a fish called <i>Asteracanthus granulosus,</i>
occurring in the Tilgate beds, is characteristic of the lowest beds
of the Neocomian of the Jura, and it is well known that <i>Corbula
alata,</i> common in the Ashburnham beds, is found also at the base
of the Neocomian of the Continent.</p>

<p><i>Area of the Wealden.</i>&mdash;In regard to the geographical
extent of the Wealden, it can not be accurately laid down, because
so much of it is concealed beneath the newer marine formations. It
has been traced about 320 English miles from west to east, from the
coast of Dorsetshire to near Boulogne, in France; and nearly 200
miles from north-west to south-east, from Surrey and Hampshire to
Vassy, in France. If the formation be continuous throughout this
space, which is very doubtful, it does not follow that the whole
was contemporaneous; because, in all likelihood, the physical
geography of the region underwent frequent changes throughout the
whole period, and the estuary may have altered its form, and even
shifted its place. Dr. Dunker, of Cassel, and H. von Meyer, in an
excellent monograph on the Wealdens of Hanover and Westphalia, have
shown that they correspond so closely, not only in their fossils,
but also in their mineral characters, with the English series, that
we can scarcely hesitate to refer the whole to one great delta.
Even then, the magnitude of the deposit may not exceed that of many
modern rivers. Thus, the delta of the Quorra or Niger, in Africa,
stretches into the interior for more than 170 miles, and occupies,
it is supposed, a space of more than 300 miles along the coast,
thus forming a surface of more than 25,000 square miles, or equal
to about one-half of England.&dagger; Besides, we know not, in such
cases, how far the fluviatile sediment and organic remains of the
river and the land may be carried out from the coast, and spread
over the bed of the sea. I have</p>

<p>shown, when treating of the Mississippi, that a more ancient
delta, including species of shells such as now inhabit Louisiana,
has been upraised, and made to occupy a wide geographical area,
while a newer delta is forming;&nbsp; and the possibility of such
movements and their effects must not be lost sight of when we
speculate on the origin of the Wealden.</p>

<p>It may be asked where the continent was placed, from the ruins
of which the Wealden strata were derived, and by the drainage of
which a great river was fed. If the Wealden was gradually going
downward 1000 feet or more perpendicularly, a large body of
fresh-water would not continue to be poured into the sea at the
same point. The adjoining land, if it participated in the movement,
could not escape being submerged. But we may suppose such land to
have been stationary, or even undergoing contemporaneous slow
upheaval. There may have been an ascending movement in one region,
and a descending one in a contiguous parallel zone of country. But
even if that were the case, it is clear that finally an extensive
depression took place in that part of Europe where the deep sea of
the Cretaceous period was afterwards brought in.</p>

<p><i>Thickness of the Wealden.</i>&mdash;In the Weald area itself,
between the North and South Downs, fresh-water beds to the
thickness of 1600 feet are known, the base not being reached.
Probably the thickness of the whole Wealden series, as seen in
Swanage Bay, can not be estimated as less than 2000 feet.</p>

<p><i>Wealden Flora.</i>&mdash;The flora of the Wealden is
characterised by a great abundance of Conifer&aelig;,
Cycade&aelig;, and Ferns, and by the absence of leaves and fruits
of Dicotyledonous Angiosperms. The discovery in 1855, in the
Hastings beds of the Isle of Wight, of Gyrogonites, or
spore-vessels of the Chara, was the first example of that genus of
plants, so common in the tertiary strata, being found in a
Secondary or Mesozoic rock.</p>
