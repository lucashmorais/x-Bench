<h1>
Paul's Letter to the Philippians
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> Paul and Timothy, servants
of Jesus Christ;
<p>To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the <a
href="#N1">overseers</a> and <a href="#N2">servants</a>:  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> Grace to you, and peace from God,
our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> I thank my God whenever I remember
you,  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> always in every
request of mine on behalf of you all making my requests with joy,  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> for your <a
href="#N3">partnership</a> in furtherance of the Good News from the first
day until now;  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> being
confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will
complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> It is even right for me to think
this way on behalf of all of you, because I have you in my heart, because,
both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News, you
all are partakers with me of grace.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> For God is my witness, how I long
after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.
<p> <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> This I pray, that your
love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment;
 <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> so that you may approve
the things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense
to the day of Christ;  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> being filled with the fruits of
righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of
God.
<p> <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> Now I desire to have
you know, <a href="#N4">brothers,</a> that the things which happened to me
have turned out rather to the progress of the Good News;  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> so that it became evident to the
whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest, that my bonds are in Christ;
 <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> and that most of the
brothers in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more
abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> Some indeed preach Christ even
out of envy and strife, and some also out of good will.  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> The former insincerely preach
Christ from selfish ambition, thinking that they add affliction to my
chains;  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> but the latter
out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the Good News.
<p> <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> What does it matter?
Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is
proclaimed. I rejoice in this, yes, and will rejoice.  <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> For I know that this will turn
out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the
Spirit of Jesus Christ,  <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> according to my earnest
expectation and hope, that I will in no way be disappointed, but with all
boldness, as always, now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether
by life, or by death.  <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> For
to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.  <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> But if I live on in the flesh,
this will bring fruit from my work; yet I don't make known what I will
choose.  <a name="C1V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:23</font></a> But I am in a
dilemma between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ,
which is far better.  <a name="C1V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:24</font></a> Yet,
to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake.  <a name="C1V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:25</font></a> Having this confidence, I know
that I will remain, yes, and remain with you all, for your progress and
joy in the faith,  <a name="C1V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:26</font></a> that
your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with
you again.
<p> <a name="C1V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:27</font></a> Only let your manner
of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ, that, whether I come and see
you or am absent, I may hear of your state, that you stand firm in one
spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the Good News;  <a name="C1V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:28</font></a> and in nothing frightened by the
adversaries, which is for them a proof of destruction, but to you of
salvation, and that from God.  <a name="C1V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:29</font></a> Because it has been granted to
you on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on
his behalf,  <a name="C1V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:30</font></a> having the
same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear is in me.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> If there is therefore
any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship
of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassion,  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> make my joy full, by being
like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;
 <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> doing nothing through
rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each counting others better
than himself;  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> each of you
not just looking to his own things, but each of you also to the things of
others.
<p> <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> Have this in your mind,
which was also in Christ Jesus,  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> who, existing in the form of God,
didn't consider equality with God a thing to be grasped,  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> but emptied himself, taking the
form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men.  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> And being found in human form, he
humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, yes, the death of the cross.
 <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> Therefore God also highly
exalted him, and gave to him the name which is above every name;  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> that at the name of Jesus every
knee should bow, of those in heaven, those on earth, and those under the
earth,  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> and that every
tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the
Father.
<p> <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> So then, my beloved,
even as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more
in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
 <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> For it is God who works
in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> Do all things without murmurings
and disputes,  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> that you
may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the
midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you are seen as
lights in the world,  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> holding up the word of life; that
I may have something to boast in the day of Christ, that I didn't run in
vain nor labor in vain.  <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> Yes, and if I am poured out on
the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice with you
all.  <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> In the same way, you
also rejoice, and rejoice with me.
<p> <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> But I hope in the Lord
Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered up when I
know how you are doing.  <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> For I have no one else
like-minded, who will truly care about you.  <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> For they all seek their own, not
the things of Jesus Christ.  <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> But you know the proof of him,
that, as a child serves a father, so he served with me in furtherance of
the Good News.  <a name="C2V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:23</font></a> Therefore
I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it will go with me.
 <a name="C2V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:24</font></a> But I trust in the Lord
that I myself also will come shortly.  <a name="C2V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:25</font></a> But I counted it necessary to
send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and
your apostle and servant of my need;  <a name="C2V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:26</font></a> since he longed for you all, and
was very troubled, because you had heard that he was sick.  <a name="C2V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:27</font></a> For indeed he was sick, nearly to
death, but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that
I might not have sorrow on sorrow.  <a name="C2V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:28</font></a> I have sent him therefore the
more diligently, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I
may be the less sorrowful.  <a name="C2V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:29</font></a> Receive him therefore in the Lord
with all joy, and hold such in honor,  <a name="C2V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:30</font></a> because for the work of Christ he
came near to death, risking his life to supply that which was lacking in
your service toward me.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Finally, my brothers,
rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not
tiresome, but for you it is safe.  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> Beware of the dogs, beware of the
evil workers, beware of the false circumcision.  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> For we are the circumcision, who
worship God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no
confidence in the flesh;  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> though I myself might have
confidence even in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has
confidence in the flesh, I yet more:  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> circumcised the eighth day, of the
stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; concerning
the law, a Pharisee;  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> concerning zeal, persecuting the
assembly; concerning the righteousness which is in the law, found
blameless.
<p> <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> However, what things
were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ.  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> Yes most certainly, and I count
all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus,
my Lord, for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and count them
nothing but refuse, that I may gain Christ  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> and be found in him, not having a
righteousness of my own, that which is of the law, but that which is
through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith;
 <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> that I may know him, and
the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings,
becoming conformed to his death;  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> if by any means I may attain to
the resurrection from the dead.  <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> Not that I have already obtained,
or am already made perfect; but I press on, if it is so that I may take
hold of that for which also I was taken hold of by Christ Jesus.
<p> <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> Brothers, I don't
regard myself as yet having taken hold, but one thing I do. Forgetting the
things which are behind, and stretching forward to the things which are
before,  <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> I press on toward
the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> Let us therefore, as many as are
perfect, think this way. If in anything you think otherwise, God will also
reveal that to you.  <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> Nevertheless, to the extent that
we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule. Let us be of the
same mind.  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> Brothers, be
imitators together of me, and note those who walk this way, even as you
have us for an example.  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> For many walk, of whom I told you
often, and now tell you even weeping, as the enemies of the cross of
Christ,  <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> whose end is
destruction, whose god is the belly, and whose glory is in their shame,
who think about earthly things.  <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> For our citizenship is in heaven,
from where we also wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ;  <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> who will change the body of our
humiliation to be conformed to the body of his glory, according to the
working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself.
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> Therefore, my brothers,
beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand firm in the Lord, my
beloved.  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> I exhort Euodia,
and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same way in the Lord.  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> Yes, I beg you also, true
yokefellow, help these women, for they labored with me in the Good News,
with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in
the book of life.  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> Rejoice
in the Lord always! Again I will say, Rejoice!  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> Let your gentleness be known to
all men. The Lord is at hand.  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> In nothing be anxious, but in
everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be
made known to God.  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> And the
peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts
and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.
<p> <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> Finally, brothers,
whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things
are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever
things are of good report; if there is any virtue, and if there is any
praise, think about these things.  <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> The things which you learned,
received, heard, and saw in me: do these things, and the God of peace will
be with you.  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> But I
rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length you have revived your
thought for me; in which you did indeed take thought, but you lacked
opportunity.  <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> Not that I
speak in respect to lack, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be
content in it.  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> I know how
to be humbled, and I know also how to abound. In everything and in all
things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both
to abound and to be in need.  <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> I can do all things through
Christ, who strengthens me.  <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> However you did well that you
shared in my affliction.  <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> You yourselves also know, you
Philippians, that in the beginning of the Good News, when I departed from
Macedonia, no assembly shared with me in the matter of giving and
receiving but you only.  <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> For even in Thessalonica you sent
once and again to my need.  <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> Not that I seek for the gift, but
I seek for the fruit that increases to your account.  <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> But I have all things, and
abound. I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things that
came from you, a sweet-smelling fragrance, an acceptable and well-pleasing
sacrifice to God.  <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> My God
will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ
Jesus.  <a name="C4V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:20</font></a> Now to our God and
Father be the glory forever and ever! Amen.
<p> <a name="C4V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:21</font></a> Greet every saint in
Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.  <a name="C4V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:22</font></a> All the saints greet you,
especially those who are of Caesar's household.  <a name="C4V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:23</font></a> The grace of the Lord Jesus
Christ be with you all. Amen.

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>In answer to various questions we have received on this:</p>

<p>We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally<br>
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with<br>

someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our<br>
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth<br>
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
