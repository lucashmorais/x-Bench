<h1>
The Letter from James
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> James, a servant of God
and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are in the
Dispersion: Greetings.  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> Count it all joy, my <a
href="#N1">brothers</a>, when you fall into various temptations,  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> knowing that the testing of your
faith produces endurance.  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> Let endurance have its perfect
work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> But if any of you lacks wisdom,
let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach; and
it will be given to him.  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> But let him ask in faith, without
any doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the
wind and tossed.  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> For let
that man not think that he will receive anything from the Lord.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> He is a double-minded man,
unstable in all his ways.
<p> <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> But let the brother in
humble circumstances glory in his high position;  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> and the rich, in that he is made
humble, because like the flower in the grass, he will pass away.  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> For the sun arises with the
scorching wind, and withers the grass, and the flower in it falls, and the
beauty of its appearance perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in
his pursuits.
<p> <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> Blessed is the man who
endures temptation, for when he has been approved, he will receive the
crown of life, which the Lord promised to those who love him.  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> Let no man say when he is
tempted, &quot;I am tempted by God,&quot; for God can't be tempted by
evil, and he himself tempts no one.  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> But each one is tempted, when he
is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> Then the lust, when it has
conceived, bears sin; and the sin, when it is full grown, brings forth
death.  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> Don't be deceived,
my beloved brothers.  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> Every good gift and every perfect
gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can
be no variation, nor turning shadow.  <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> Of his own will he brought us
forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of
his creatures.
<p> <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> So, then, my beloved
brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to
anger;  <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> for the anger of
man doesn't produce the righteousness of God.  <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> Therefore, putting away all
filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with humility the
implanted word, which is able to <a href="#N2">save your souls</a>.
 <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> But be doers of the word,
and not only hearers, deluding your own selves.  <a name="C1V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:23</font></a> For if anyone is a hearer of the
word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a
mirror;  <a name="C1V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:24</font></a> for he sees
himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was.
 <a name="C1V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:25</font></a> But he who looks into the
perfect law of freedom, and continues, not being a hearer who forgets, but
a doer of the work, this man will be blessed in what he does.
<p> <a name="C1V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:26</font></a> If anyone among you
thinks himself to be religious while he doesn't bridle his tongue, but
deceives his heart, this man's religion is worthless.  <a name="C1V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:27</font></a> Pure religion and undefiled
before our God and Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in
their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> My brothers, don't hold
the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with partiality.  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> For if a man with a gold ring, in
fine clothing, comes into your <a href="#N3">synagogue</a>, and a poor man
in filthy clothing also comes in;  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> and you pay special attention to
him who wears the fine clothing, and say, &quot;Sit here in a good
place;&quot; and you tell the poor man, &quot;Stand there,&quot; or
&quot;Sit by my footstool;&quot;  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> haven't you shown partiality among
yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> Listen, my beloved brothers.
Didn't God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith,
and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him?  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> But you have dishonored the poor
man. Don't the rich oppress you, and personally drag you before the
courts?  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> Don't they
blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> However, if you fulfill the royal
law, according to the Scripture, &quot;You shall love your neighbor as
yourself,&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N4">*</a></sup></font> you do well.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> But if you show partiality, you
commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> For whoever keeps the whole law,
and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all.  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> For he who said, &quot;Do not
commit adultery,&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N5">*</a></sup></font> also said, &quot;Do not commit
murder.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N6">*</a></sup></font> Now if you do not commit adultery, but
murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> So speak, and so do, as men who
are to be judged by a law of freedom.  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> For judgment is without mercy to
him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
<p> <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> What good is it, my
brothers, if a man says he has faith, but has no works? Can faith save
him?  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> And if a brother or
sister is naked and in lack of daily food,  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> and one of you tells them,
&quot;Go in peace, be warmed and filled;&quot; and yet you didn't give
them the things the body needs, what good is it?  <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> Even so faith, if it has no
works, is dead in itself.  <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> Yes, a man will say, &quot;You
have faith, and I have works.&quot; Show me your faith without works, and
I by my works will show you my faith.
<p> <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> You believe that God
is one. You do well. The demons also believe, and shudder.  <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> But do you want to know, vain
man, that faith apart from works is dead?  <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> Wasn't Abraham our father
justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?
 <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> You see that faith worked
with his works, and by works faith was perfected;  <a name="C2V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:23</font></a> and the Scripture was fulfilled
which says, &quot;Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as
righteousness;&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N7">*</a></sup></font> and he was called the friend of God.  <a name="C2V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:24</font></a> You see then that by works, a man
is justified, and not only by faith.  <a name="C2V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:25</font></a> In like manner wasn't Rahab the
prostitute also justified by works, in that she received the messengers,
and sent them out another way?  <a name="C2V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:26</font></a> For as the body apart from the
spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Let not many of you be
teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment.
 <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> For in many things we all
stumble. If anyone doesn't stumble in word, the same is a perfect man,
able to bridle the whole body also.  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> Indeed, we put bits into the
horses' mouths so that they may obey us, and we guide their whole body.
 <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> Behold, the ships also,
though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds, are yet guided by a
very small rudder, wherever the pilot desires.  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> So the tongue is also a little
member, and boasts great things. See how a small fire can spread to a
large forest!  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> And the
tongue is a fire. The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue,
which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature, and
is set on fire by <a href="#N8">Gehenna.</a>  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> For every kind of animal, bird,
creeping thing, and thing in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by
mankind.  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> But nobody can
tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> With it we bless our God and
Father, and with it we curse men, who are made in the image of God.
 <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> Out of the same mouth
comes forth blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to
be so.  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> Does a spring send
out from the same opening fresh and bitter water?  <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> Can a fig tree, my brothers,
yield olives, or a vine figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and
fresh water.
<p> <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> Who is wise and
understanding among you? Let him show by his good conduct that his deeds
are done in gentleness of wisdom.  <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> But if you have bitter jealousy
and selfish ambition in your heart, don't boast and don't lie against the
truth.  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> This wisdom is not
that which comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demonic.
 <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> For where jealousy and
selfish ambition are, there is confusion and every evil deed.  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> But the wisdom that is from above
is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good
fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> Now the fruit of righteousness is
sown in peace by those who make peace.
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> Where do wars and
fightings among you come from? Don't they come from your pleasures that
war in your members?  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> You
lust, and don't have. You kill, covet, and can't obtain. You fight and
make war. You don't have, because you don't ask.  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> You ask, and don't receive,
because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it for your
pleasures.  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> You adulterers
and adulteresses, don't you know that friendship with the world is enmity
with God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes
himself an enemy of God.  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> Or do you think that the Scripture
says in vain, &quot;The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously&quot;?
 <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> But he gives more grace.
Therefore it says, &quot;God resists the proud, but gives grace to the
humble.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N9">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> Be subject therefore to God. But
resist the devil, and he will flee from you.  <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> Draw near to God, and he will draw
near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you
double-minded.  <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> Lament,
mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to
gloom.  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> Humble yourselves
in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.
<p> <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> Don't speak against
one another, brothers. He who speaks against a brother and judges his
brother, speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the
law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> Only one is the lawgiver, who is
able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge another?
<p> <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> Come now, you who say,
&quot;Today or tomorrow let's go into this city, and spend a year there,
trade, and make a profit.&quot;  <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> Whereas you don't know what your
life will be like tomorrow. For what is your life? For you are a vapor,
that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away.  <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> For you ought to say, &quot;If
the Lord wills, we will both live, and do this or that.&quot;  <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> But now you glory in your
boasting. All such boasting is evil.  <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> To him therefore who knows to do
good, and doesn't do it, to him it is sin.
<p> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> Come now, you rich,
weep and howl for your miseries that are coming on you.  <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> Your riches are corrupted and your
garments are moth-eaten.  <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> Your gold and your silver are
corroded, and their corrosion will be for a testimony against you, and
will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up your treasure in the last
days.  <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> Behold, the wages of
the laborers who mowed your fields, which you have kept back by fraud, cry
out, and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the
Lord of <a href="#N10">Armies</a>.  <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> You have lived delicately on the
earth, and taken your pleasure. You have nourished your hearts as in a day
of slaughter.  <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> You have
condemned, you have murdered the righteous one. He doesn't resist you.
<p> <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> Be patient therefore,
brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the
precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receives the
early and late rain.  <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> You
also be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at
hand.
<p> <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> Don't grumble,
brothers, against one another, so that you won't be judged. Behold, the
judge stands at the door.  <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> Take, brothers, for an example of
suffering and of patience, the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
 <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> Behold, we call them
blessed who endured. You have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen
the Lord in the outcome, and how the Lord is full of compassion and mercy.
 <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> But above all things, my
brothers, don't swear, neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any
other oath; but let your &quot;yes&quot; be &quot;yes,&quot; and your
&quot;no,&quot; &quot;no;&quot; so that you don't fall <a href="#N11">into
hypocrisy.</a>
<p> <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> Is any among you
suffering? Let him pray. Is any cheerful? Let him sing praises.  <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> Is any among you sick? Let him
call for the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, anointing
him with oil in the name of the Lord,  <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> and the prayer of faith will heal
him who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. If he has committed sins,
he will be forgiven.  <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> Confess your offenses to one
another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The insistent
prayer of a righteous person is powerfully effective.  <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> Elijah was a man with a nature
like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it didn't
rain on the earth for three years and six months.  <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> He prayed again, and the sky gave
rain, and the earth brought forth its fruit.
<p> <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> Brothers, if any among
you wanders from the truth, and someone turns him back,  <a name="C5V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:20</font></a> let him know that he who turns a
sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death, and will
cover a multitude of sins.

US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Just search by the first five letters of the filename you
want,<br>as it appears in our Newsletters.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>

ways.</p>

They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with<br>

someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our<br>
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth<br>
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that<br>
time to the person you received it from. If you received it<br>

choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to<br>
receive it electronically.</p>
