mentioned by name were princes in their families: and their fathers'
houses increased greatly.  <a name="C4V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:39</font></a> They went to the entrance of
Gedor, even to the east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their
flocks.  <a name="C4V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:40</font></a> They found fat
pasture and good, and the land was wide, and quiet, and peaceable; for
those who lived there before were of Ham.  <a name="C4V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:41</font></a> These written by name came in the
days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and struck their tents, and the Meunim who
were found there, and destroyed them utterly to this day, and lived in
their place; because there was pasture there for their flocks.  <a name="C4V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:42</font></a> Some of them, even of the sons of
Simeon, five hundred men, went to Mount Seir, having for their captains

Amalekites who escaped, and have lived there to this day.
<p> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> The sons of Reuben the
firstborn of Israel (for he was the firstborn; but, because he defiled his
father's couch, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of
Israel; and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright.
 <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> For Judah prevailed above
his brothers, and of him came the prince; but the birthright was
Joseph's:)  <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> the sons of
Reuben the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.

prince of the Reubenites.  <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> His brothers by their families,
when the genealogy of their generations was reckoned: the chief, Jeiel,
and Zechariah,  <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> and Bela
the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who lived in Aroer,
even to Nebo and Baal Meon:  <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> and eastward he lived even to the
entrance of the wilderness from the river Euphrates, because their
livestock were multiplied in the land of Gilead.  <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> In the days of Saul, they made
war with the Hagrites, who fell by their hand; and they lived in their
tents throughout all the <I>land</I> east of Gilead.  <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> The sons of Gad lived over
against them, in the land of Bashan to Salecah:  <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> Joel the chief, and Shapham the
second, and Janai, and Shaphat in Bashan.  <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> Their brothers of their fathers'
houses: Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jacan, and Zia,
and Eber, seven.  <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> These
were the sons of Abihail, the son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of
Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the
son of Buz;  <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> Ahi the son
of Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of their fathers' houses.  <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> They lived in Gilead in Bashan,
and in its towns, and in all the suburbs of Sharon, as far as their
borders.  <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> All these were
reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham king of Judah, and in the
days of Jeroboam king of Israel.  <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> The sons of Reuben, and the
Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear
buckler and sword, and to shoot with bow, and skillful in war, were
forty-four thousand seven hundred and sixty, that were able to go forth to
war.  <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> They made war with
the Hagrites, with Jetur, and Naphish, and Nodab.  <a name="C5V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:20</font></a> They were helped against them,
and the Hagrites were delivered into their hand, and all who were with
them; for they cried to God in the battle, and he was entreated of them,
because they put their trust in him.  <a name="C5V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:21</font></a> They took away their livestock;
of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred fifty thousand,
and of donkeys two thousand, and of men one hundred thousand.  <a name="C5V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:22</font></a> For there fell many slain,
because the war was of God. They lived in their place until the captivity.
 <a name="C5V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:23</font></a> The children of the
half-tribe of Manasseh lived in the land: they increased from Bashan to
Baal Hermon and Senir and Mount Hermon.  <a name="C5V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:24</font></a> These were the heads of their
fathers' houses: even Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and
Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valor, famous men,
heads of their fathers' houses.  <a name="C5V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:25</font></a> They trespassed against the God
of their fathers, and played the prostitute after the gods of the peoples
of the land, whom God destroyed before them.  <a name="C5V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:26</font></a> The God of Israel stirred up the
spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath Pilneser king of
Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites,
and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, and Habor, and
Hara, and to the river of Gozan, to this day.

porters: Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman, and their brothers
(Shallum was the chief),  <a name="C9V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:18</font></a> who hitherto <I>waited</I> in the
king's gate eastward: they were the porters for the camp of the children
of Levi.  <a name="C9V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:19</font></a> Shallum the son
of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brothers, of his
father's house, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers
of the thresholds of the tent: and their fathers had been over the camp of
Yahweh, keepers of the entry.  <a name="C9V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:20</font></a> Phinehas the son of Eleazar was
ruler over them in time past, <I>and</I> Yahweh was with him.  <a name="C9V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:21</font></a> Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah
was porter of the door of the Tent of Meeting.  <a name="C9V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:22</font></a> All these who were chosen to be
porters in the thresholds were two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned
by genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain
in their office of trust.  <a name="C9V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:23</font></a> So they and their children had
the oversight of the gates of the house of Yahweh, even the house of the
tent, by wards.  <a name="C9V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:24</font></a> On the
four sides were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and south.
 <a name="C9V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:25</font></a> Their brothers, in their
villages, were to come in every seven days from time to time to be with
them:  <a name="C9V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:26</font></a> for the four chief
porters, who were Levites, were in an office of trust, and were over the
chambers and over the treasuries in the house of God.  <a name="C9V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:27</font></a> They lodged around the house of
God, because that duty was on them; and to them pertained its opening
morning by morning.  <a name="C9V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:28</font></a> Certain of them were in charge of
the vessels of service; for by count were these brought in and by count
were these taken out.  <a name="C9V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:29</font></a> Some of them also were appointed
over the furniture, and over all the vessels of the sanctuary, and over
the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the
spices.  <a name="C9V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:30</font></a> Some of the sons
of the priests prepared the confection of the spices.  <a name="C9V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:31</font></a> Mattithiah, one of the Levites,
who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the office of trust
over the things that were baked in pans.  <a name="C9V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:32</font></a> Some of their brothers, of the
sons of the Kohathites, were over the show bread, to prepare it every
Sabbath.  <a name="C9V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:33</font></a> These are the
singers, heads of fathers' <I>houses</I> of the Levites, <I>who lived</I>
in the chambers <I>and were</I> free <I>from other service</I>; for they
were employed in their work day and night.  <a name="C9V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:34</font></a> These were heads of fathers'
<I>houses</I> of the Levites, throughout their generations, chief men:
these lived at Jerusalem.  <a name="C9V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:35</font></a> In Gibeon there lived the father

became the father of Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.
 <a name="C9V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:40</font></a> The son of Jonathan was
Merib Baal; and Merib Baal became the father of Micah.  <a name="C9V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:41</font></a> The sons of Micah: Pithon, and
Melech, and Tahrea, <I>and Ahaz</I>.  <a name="C9V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:42</font></a> Ahaz became the father of Jarah;
and Jarah became the father of Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri
became the father of Moza;  <a name="C9V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:43</font></a> and Moza became the father of
Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son.  <a name="C9V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:44</font></a> Azel had six sons, whose names
are these: Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and
Hanan: these were the sons of Azel.
<p>  <a name="C10V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:1</font></a> Now the Philistines
fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the
Philistines, and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa.  <a name="C10V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:2</font></a> The Philistines followed hard
after Saul and after his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan, and
Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.  <a name="C10V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:3</font></a> The battle went sore against
Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was distressed by reason of the
archers.  <a name="C10V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:4</font></a> Then said Saul
to his armor bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through therewith,
lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armor bearer would
not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell on
it.  <a name="C10V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:5</font></a> When his armor bearer
saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword, and died.  <a name="C10V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:6</font></a> So Saul died, and his three sons;
and all his house died together.  <a name="C10V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:7</font></a> When all the men of Israel who
were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were
dead, they forsook their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and
lived in them.  <a name="C10V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:8</font></a> It
happened on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain,
that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.  <a name="C10V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:9</font></a> They stripped him, and took his
head, and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines all around,
to carry the news to their idols, and to the people.  <a name="C10V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:10</font></a> They put his armor in the house
of their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon.  <a name="C10V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:11</font></a> When all Jabesh Gilead heard all
that the Philistines had done to Saul,  <a name="C10V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:12</font></a> all the valiant men arose, and
took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them
to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted
seven days.  <a name="C10V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:13</font></a> So Saul died
for his trespass which he committed against Yahweh, because of the word of
Yahweh, which he didn't keep; and also because he asked counsel of one who
had a familiar spirit, to inquire <I>thereby</I>,  <a name="C10V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:14</font></a> and didn't inquire of Yahweh:
therefore he killed him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.
<p> <a name="C11V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:1</font></a> Then all Israel
gathered themselves to David to Hebron, saying, Behold, we are your bone
and your flesh.  <a name="C11V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:2</font></a> In times
past, even when Saul was king, it was you who led out and brought in
Israel: and Yahweh your God said to you, You shall be shepherd of my
people Israel, and you shall be prince over my people Israel.  <a name="C11V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:3</font></a> So all the elders of Israel came
to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron
before Yahweh; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the
word of Yahweh by Samuel.  <a name="C11V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:4</font></a> David and all Israel went to
Jerusalem (the same is Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the
land, were there.  <a name="C11V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:5</font></a> The
inhabitants of Jebus said to David, You shall not come in here.
Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of
David.  <a name="C11V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:6</font></a> David said,
Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. Joab the
son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief.  <a name="C11V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:7</font></a> David lived in the stronghold;
therefore they called it the city of David.  <a name="C11V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:8</font></a> He built the city all around,
from Millo even around; and Joab repaired the rest of the city.  <a name="C11V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:9</font></a> David grew greater and greater;
for Yahweh of Armies was with him.  <a name="C11V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:10</font></a> Now these are the chief of the
mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his
kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word
of Yahweh concerning Israel.  <a name="C11V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:11</font></a> This is the number of the mighty
men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the
thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at
one time.  <a name="C11V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:12</font></a> After him was
Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.
 <a name="C11V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:13</font></a> He was with David at
Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle,
where there was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from
before the Philistines.  <a name="C11V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:14</font></a> They stood in the midst of the
plot, and defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh saved them
by a great victory.  <a name="C11V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:15</font></a> Three of the thirty chief men
went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of
the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim.  <a name="C11V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:16</font></a> David was then in the
stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
 <a name="C11V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:17</font></a> David longed, and said,
Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem, which
is by the gate!  <a name="C11V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:18</font></a> The
three broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the
well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to
David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to Yahweh,
 <a name="C11V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:19</font></a> and said, My God forbid
it me, that I should do this: shall I drink the blood of these men who
have put their lives in jeopardy? for with <I>the jeopardy of</I> their
lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did
the three mighty men.  <a name="C11V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:20</font></a> Abishai, the brother of Joab, he
was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred
and killed them, and had a name among the three.  <a name="C11V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:21</font></a> Of the three, he was more
honorable than the two, and was made their captain: however he didn't
attain to the <I>first</I> three.  <a name="C11V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:22</font></a> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the
son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he killed the
two <I>sons of</I> Ariel of Moab: he went down also and killed a lion in
the midst of a pit in time of snow.  <a name="C11V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:23</font></a> He killed an Egyptian, a man of
great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear
like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked
the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.
 <a name="C11V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:24</font></a> These things did Benaiah
the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men.  <a name="C11V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:25</font></a> Behold, he was more honorable
than the thirty, but he didn't attain to the <I>first</I> three: and David
set him over his guard.  <a name="C11V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:26</font></a> Also the mighty men of the
armies: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
 <a name="C11V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:27</font></a> Shammoth the Harorite,
Helez the Pelonite,  <a name="C11V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:28</font></a> Ira
the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,  <a name="C11V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:29</font></a> Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai
the Ahohite,  <a name="C11V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:30</font></a> Maharai the
Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,  <a name="C11V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:31</font></a> Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah
of the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,  <a name="C11V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:32</font></a> Hurai of the brooks of Gaash,
Abiel the Arbathite,  <a name="C11V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:33</font></a> Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba
the Shaalbonite,  <a name="C11V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:34</font></a> the
sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shagee the Hararite,
 <a name="C11V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:35</font></a> Ahiam the son of Sacar
the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,  <a name="C11V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:36</font></a> Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah
the Pelonite,  <a name="C11V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:37</font></a> Hezro the
Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,  <a name="C11V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:38</font></a> Joel the brother of Nathan,
Mibhar the son of Hagri,  <a name="C11V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:39</font></a> Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the
Berothite, the armor bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,  <a name="C11V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:40</font></a> Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the
Ithrite,  <a name="C11V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:41</font></a> Uriah the
Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,  <a name="C11V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:42</font></a> Adina the son of Shiza the
Reubenite, a chief of the Reubenites, and thirty with him,  <a name="C11V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:43</font></a> Hanan the son of Maacah, and
Joshaphat the Mithnite,  <a name="C11V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:44</font></a> Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama
and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,  <a name="C11V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:45</font></a> Jediael the son of Shimri, and
Joha his brother, the Tizite,  <a name="C11V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:46</font></a> Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai,
and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,  <a name="C11V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:47</font></a> Eliel, and Obed, and Jaasiel the
Mezobaite.
<p> <a name="C12V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:1</font></a> Now these are those
who came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of
Saul the son of Kish; and they were among the mighty men, his helpers in
war.  <a name="C12V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:2</font></a> They were armed with
bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones
and in shooting arrows from the bow: they were of Saul's brothers of
Benjamin.  <a name="C12V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:3</font></a> The chief was
Ahiezer; then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite, and Jeziel, and
Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth, and Beracah, and Jehu the Anathothite,
 <a name="C12V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:4</font></a> and Ishmaiah the
Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty, and
Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Jozabad the Gederathite,  <a name="C12V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:5</font></a> Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and
Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite,  <a name="C12V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:6</font></a> Elkanah, and Isshiah, and Azarel,
and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites,  <a name="C12V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:7</font></a> and Joelah, and Zebadiah, the
sons of Jeroham of Gedor.  <a name="C12V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:8</font></a> Of the Gadites there separated
themselves to David to the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of
valor, men trained for war, that could handle shield and spear; whose
faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as the roes on
the mountains;  <a name="C12V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:9</font></a> Ezer the
chief, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,  <a name="C12V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:10</font></a> Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah
the fifth,  <a name="C12V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:11</font></a> Attai the
sixth, Eliel the seventh,  <a name="C12V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:12</font></a> Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the
ninth,  <a name="C12V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:13</font></a> Jeremiah the
tenth, Machbannai the eleventh.  <a name="C12V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:14</font></a> These of the sons of Gad were
captains of the army: he who was least was equal to one hundred, and the
greatest to one thousand.  <a name="C12V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:15</font></a> These are those who went over
the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and
they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and
toward the west.  <a name="C12V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:16</font></a> There
came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the stronghold to David.
 <a name="C12V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:17</font></a> David went out to meet
them, and answered them, If you be come peaceably to me to help me, my
heart shall be knit to you; but if <I>you be come</I> to betray me to my
adversaries, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers
look thereon, and rebuke it.  <a name="C12V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:18</font></a> Then the Spirit came on Amasai,
who was chief of the thirty, <I>and he said</I>, &quot;We are yours,
David, and on your side, you son of Jesse: peace, peace be to you, and
peace be to your helpers; for your God helps you.&quot; Then David
received them, and made them captains of the band.  <a name="C12V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:19</font></a> Of Manasseh also there fell away
some to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle:
but they didn't help them; for the lords of the Philistines sent him away
after consultation, saying, He will fall away to his master Saul to the
jeopardy of our heads.  <a name="C12V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:20</font></a> As he went to Ziklag, there fell
to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and
Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands who were of
Manasseh.  <a name="C12V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:21</font></a> They helped
David against the band of rovers: for they were all mighty men of valor,
and were captains in the army.  <a name="C12V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:22</font></a> For from day to day men came to
David to help him, until there was a great army, like the army of God.
 <a name="C12V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:23</font></a> These are the numbers of
the heads of those who were armed for war, who came to David to Hebron, to
turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of Yahweh.  <a name="C12V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:24</font></a> The children of Judah who bore
shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, armed for war.
 <a name="C12V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:25</font></a> Of the children of
Simeon, mighty men of valor for the war, seven thousand and one hundred.
 <a name="C12V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:26</font></a> Of the children of Levi
four thousand and six hundred.  <a name="C12V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:27</font></a> Jehoiada was the leader of
<I>the house of</I> Aaron; and with him were three thousand and seven
hundred,  <a name="C12V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:28</font></a> and Zadok, a
young man mighty of valor, and of his father's house twenty-two captains.
 <a name="C12V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:29</font></a> Of the children of
Benjamin, the brothers of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest
part of them had kept their allegiance to the house of Saul.  <a name="C12V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:30</font></a> Of the children of Ephraim
twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous men in their
fathers' houses.  <a name="C12V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:31</font></a> Of the
half-tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were mentioned by name, to
come and make David king.  <a name="C12V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:32</font></a> Of the children of Issachar, men
who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, the
heads of them were two hundred; and all their brothers were at their
commandment.  <a name="C12V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:33</font></a> Of Zebulun,
such as were able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in
array, with all manner of instruments of war, fifty thousand, and who
could order <I>the battle array, and were</I> not of double heart.  <a name="C12V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:34</font></a> Of Naphtali one thousand
captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty-seven thousand.
 <a name="C12V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:35</font></a> Of the Danites who could
set the battle in array, twenty-eight thousand six hundred.  <a name="C12V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:36</font></a> Of Asher, such as were able to
go out in the army, who could set the battle in array, forty thousand.
 <a name="C12V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:37</font></a> On the other side of the
Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half-tribe of
Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, one
hundred twenty thousand.  <a name="C12V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:38</font></a> All these being men of war, who
could order the battle array, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make
David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one
heart to make David king.  <a name="C12V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:39</font></a> They were there with David three
days, eating and drinking; for their brothers had made preparation for
them.  <a name="C12V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:40</font></a> Moreover those who
were near to them, <I>even</I> as far as Issachar and Zebulun and
Naphtali, brought bread on donkeys, and on camels, and on mules, and on
oxen, food of meal, cakes of figs, and clusters of raisins, and wine, and
oil, and cattle, and sheep in abundance: for there was joy in Israel.
<p> <a name="C13V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:1</font></a> David consulted with
the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader.  <a name="C13V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:2</font></a> David said to all the assembly of
Israel, If it seem good to you, and if it be of Yahweh our God, let us
send abroad everywhere to our brothers who are left in all the land of
Israel, with whom the priests and Levites are in their cities that have
suburbs, that they may gather themselves to us;  <a name="C13V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:3</font></a> and let us bring again the ark of
our God to us: for we didn't seek it in the days of Saul.  <a name="C13V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:4</font></a> All the assembly said that they
would do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
 <a name="C13V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:5</font></a> So David assembled all
Israel together, from the Shihor <I>the brook</I> of Egypt even to the
entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim.  <a name="C13V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:6</font></a> David went up, and all Israel, to
Baalah, <I>that is</I>, to Kiriath Jearim, which belonged to Judah, to
bring up from there the ark of God Yahweh that sits <I>above</I> the
cherubim, that is called by the Name.  <a name="C13V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:7</font></a> They carried the ark of God on a
new cart, <I>and brought it</I> out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and
Ahio drove the cart.  <a name="C13V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:8</font></a> David and all Israel played
before God with all their might, even with songs, and with harps, and with
stringed instruments, and with tambourines, and with cymbals, and with
trumpets.  <a name="C13V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:9</font></a> When they came
to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark;
for the oxen stumbled.  <a name="C13V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:10</font></a> The anger of Yahweh was kindled
against Uzza, and he struck him, because he put forth his hand to the ark;
and there he died before God.  <a name="C13V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:11</font></a> David was displeased, because
Yahweh had broken forth on Uzza; and he called that place Perez Uzza, to
this day.  <a name="C13V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:12</font></a> David was
afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to
me?  <a name="C13V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:13</font></a> So David didn't move
the ark to him into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house
of Obed-Edom the Gittite.  <a name="C13V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:14</font></a> The ark of God remained with the
family of Obed-Edom in his house three months: and Yahweh blessed the
house of Obed-Edom, and all that he had.
<p> <a name="C14V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:1</font></a> Hiram king of Tyre
sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and masons, and carpenters, to
build him a house.  <a name="C14V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:2</font></a> David
perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel; for his
kingdom was exalted on high, for his people Israel's sake.  <a name="C14V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:3</font></a> David took more wives at
Jerusalem; and David became the father of more sons and daughters.  <a name="C14V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:4</font></a> These are the names of the
children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and
Solomon,  <a name="C14V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:5</font></a> and Ibhar, and
Elishua, and Elpelet,  <a name="C14V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:6</font></a> and
Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,  <a name="C14V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:7</font></a> and Elishama, and Beeliada, and
Eliphelet.  <a name="C14V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:8</font></a> When the
Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the
Philistines went up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out
against them.  <a name="C14V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:9</font></a> Now the
Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.  <a name="C14V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:10</font></a> David inquired of God, saying,
Shall I go up against the Philistines? and will you deliver them into my
hand? Yahweh said to him, Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand.
 <a name="C14V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:11</font></a> So they came up to Baal
Perazim, and David struck them there; and David said, God has broken my
enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the
name of that place Baal Perazim.  <a name="C14V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:12</font></a> They left their gods there; and
David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire.  <a name="C14V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:13</font></a> The Philistines yet again made a
raid in the valley.  <a name="C14V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:14</font></a> David inquired again of God; and
God said to him, You shall not go up after them: turn away from them, and
come on them over against the mulberry trees.  <a name="C14V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:15</font></a> It shall be, when you hear the
sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall
go out to battle; for God is gone out before you to strike the army of the
Philistines.  <a name="C14V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:16</font></a> David did
as God commanded him: and they struck the army of the Philistines from
Gibeon even to Gezer.  <a name="C14V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:17</font></a> The fame of David went out into
all lands; and Yahweh brought the fear of him on all nations.
<p> <a name="C15V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:1</font></a> <I>David</I> made him
houses in the city of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God,
and pitched for it a tent.  <a name="C15V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:2</font></a> Then David said, None ought to
carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them has Yahweh chosen to carry
the ark of God, and to minister to him forever.  <a name="C15V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:3</font></a> David assembled all Israel at
Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Yahweh to its place, which he had
prepared for it.  <a name="C15V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:4</font></a> David
gathered together the sons of Aaron, and the Levites:  <a name="C15V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:5</font></a> of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the
chief, and his brothers one hundred twenty;  <a name="C15V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:6</font></a> of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the
chief, and his brothers two hundred twenty;  <a name="C15V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:7</font></a> of the sons of Gershom, Joel the
chief, and his brothers one hundred thirty;  <a name="C15V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:8</font></a> of the sons of Elizaphan,
Shemaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred;  <a name="C15V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:9</font></a> of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the
chief, and his brothers eighty;  <a name="C15V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:10</font></a> of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab
the chief, and his brothers one hundred twelve.  <a name="C15V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:11</font></a> David called for Zadok and
Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel,
Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,  <a name="C15V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:12</font></a> and said to them, You are the
heads of the fathers' <I>houses</I> of the Levites: sanctify yourselves,
both you and your brothers, that you may bring up the ark of Yahweh, the
God of Israel, to <I>the place</I> that I have prepared for it.  <a name="C15V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:13</font></a> For because you didn't carry it
at the first, Yahweh our God made a breach on us, because we didn't seek
him according to the ordinance.  <a name="C15V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:14</font></a> So the priests and the Levites
sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
 <a name="C15V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:15</font></a> The children of the
Levites bore the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles thereon, as
Moses commanded according to the word of Yahweh.  <a name="C15V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:16</font></a> David spoke to the chief of the
Levites to appoint their brothers the singers, with instruments of music,
stringed instruments and harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up
the voice with joy.  <a name="C15V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:17</font></a> So
the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers, Asaph
the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brothers, Ethan the
son of Kushaiah;  <a name="C15V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:18</font></a> and
with them their brothers of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and
Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and
Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom, and
Jeiel, the doorkeepers.  <a name="C15V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:19</font></a> So the singers, Heman, Asaph,
and Ethan, <I>were appointed</I> with cymbals of brass to sound aloud;
 <a name="C15V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:20</font></a> and Zechariah, and
Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and
Benaiah, with stringed instruments set to Alamoth;  <a name="C15V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:21</font></a> and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu,
and Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps tuned to
the eight-stringed lyre, to lead.  <a name="C15V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:22</font></a> Chenaniah, chief of the Levites,
was over the song: he instructed about the song, because he was skillful.
 <a name="C15V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:23</font></a> Berechiah and Elkanah
were doorkeepers for the ark.  <a name="C15V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:24</font></a> Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and
Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the
priests, did blow the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-Edom and
Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.  <a name="C15V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:25</font></a> So David, and the elders of
Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the
covenant of Yahweh out of the house of Obed-Edom with joy.  <a name="C15V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:26</font></a> It happened, when God helped the
Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, that they sacrificed
seven bulls and seven rams.  <a name="C15V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:27</font></a> David was clothed with a robe of
fine linen, and all the Levites who bore the ark, and the singers, and
Chenaniah the master of the song <I>with</I> the singers: and David had on
him an ephod of linen.  <a name="C15V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:28</font></a> Thus all Israel brought up the
ark of the covenant of Yahweh with shouting, and with sound of the cornet,
and with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with stringed
instruments and harps.  <a name="C15V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:29</font></a> It happened, as the ark of the
covenant of Yahweh came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of
Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and playing; and
she despised him in her heart.
<p> <a name="C16V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:1</font></a> They brought in the
ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for
it: and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.
 <a name="C16V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:2</font></a> When David had made an
end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the
people in the name of Yahweh.  <a name="C16V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:3</font></a> He dealt to everyone of Israel,
both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion <I>of
flesh</I>, and a cake of raisins.  <a name="C16V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:4</font></a> He appointed certain of the
Levites to minister before the ark of Yahweh, and to celebrate and to
thank and praise Yahweh, the God of Israel:  <a name="C16V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:5</font></a> Asaph the chief, and second to
him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and
Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, with stringed instruments
and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;  <a name="C16V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:6</font></a> and Benaiah and Jahaziel the
priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.
<p> <a name="C16V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:7</font></a> Then on that day David
first ordained to give thanks to Yahweh, by the hand of Asaph and his
brothers.

<p>All the people said, Amen, and praised Yahweh.
<p> <a name="C16V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:37</font></a> So he left there,
before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, Asaph and his brothers, to
minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required;  <a name="C16V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:38</font></a> and Obed-Edom with their
brothers, sixty-eight; Obed-Edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be
doorkeepers;  <a name="C16V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:39</font></a> and Zadok
the priest, and his brothers the priests, before the tent of Yahweh in the
high place that was at Gibeon,  <a name="C16V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:40</font></a> to offer burnt offerings to
Yahweh on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening,
even according to all that is written in the law of Yahweh, which he
commanded to Israel;  <a name="C16V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:41</font></a> and
with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest who were chosen, who were
mentioned by name, to give thanks to Yahweh, because his loving kindness
endures forever;  <a name="C16V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:42</font></a> and
with them Heman and Jeduthun <I>with</I> trumpets and cymbals for those
that should sound aloud, and <I>with</I> instruments for the songs of God;
and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate.  <a name="C16V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:43</font></a> All the people departed every
man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.
<p> <a name="C17V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:1</font></a> It happened, when
David lived in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Behold, I
dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Yahweh
<I>dwells</I> under curtains.  <a name="C17V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:2</font></a> Nathan said to David, Do all that
is in your heart; for God is with you.  <a name="C17V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:3</font></a> It happened the same night, that
the word of God came to Nathan, saying,  <a name="C17V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:4</font></a> Go and tell David my servant,
Thus says Yahweh, You shall not build me a house to dwell in:  <a name="C17V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:5</font></a> for I have not lived in a house
since the day that I brought up Israel, to this day, but have gone from
tent to tent, and from <I>one</I> tent <I>to another</I>.  <a name="C17V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:6</font></a> In all places in which I have
walked with all Israel, spoke I a word with any of the judges of Israel,
whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, Why have you not
built me a house of cedar?  <a name="C17V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:7</font></a> Now therefore thus you shall tell
my servant David, Thus says Yahweh of Armies, I took you from the sheep
pen, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people
Israel:  <a name="C17V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:8</font></a> and I have been
with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from
before you; and I will make you a name, like the name of the great ones
who are in the earth.  <a name="C17V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:9</font></a> I
will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they
may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the
children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first,  <a name="C17V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:10</font></a> and <I>as</I> from the day that
I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all your
enemies. Moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house.  <a name="C17V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:11</font></a> It shall happen, when your days
are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up
your seed after you, who shall be of your sons; and I will establish his
kingdom.  <a name="C17V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:12</font></a> He shall build
me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.  <a name="C17V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:13</font></a> I will be his father, and he
shall be my son: and I will not take my loving kindness away from him, as
I took it from him that was before you;  <a name="C17V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:14</font></a> but I will settle him in my
house and in my kingdom forever; and his throne shall be established
forever.  <a name="C17V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:15</font></a> According to
all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to
David.  <a name="C17V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:16</font></a> Then David the
king went in, and sat before Yahweh; and he said, Who am I, Yahweh God,
and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?  <a name="C17V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:17</font></a> This was a small thing in your
eyes, God; but you have spoken of your servant's house for a great while
to come, and have regarded me according to the estate of a man of high
degree, Yahweh God.  <a name="C17V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:18</font></a> What
can David <I>say</I> yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to
your servant? for you know your servant.  <a name="C17V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:19</font></a> Yahweh, for your servant's sake,
and according to your own heart, have you worked all this greatness, to
make known all <I>these</I> great things.  <a name="C17V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:20</font></a> Yahweh, there is none like you,
neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard
with our ears.  <a name="C17V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:21</font></a> What one
nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to
himself for a people, to make you a name by great and awesome things, in
driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeem out of Egypt?
 <a name="C17V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:22</font></a> For your people Israel
did you make your own people forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.
 <a name="C17V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:23</font></a> Now, Yahweh, let the
word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his
house, be established forever, and do as you have spoken.  <a name="C17V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:24</font></a> Let your name be established and
magnified forever, saying, Yahweh of Armies is the God of Israel, even a
God to Israel: and the house of David your servant is established before
you.  <a name="C17V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:25</font></a> For you, my God,
have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house: therefore
has your servant found <I>in his heart</I> to pray before you.  <a name="C17V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:26</font></a> Now, Yahweh, you are God, and
have promised this good thing to your servant:  <a name="C17V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:27</font></a> and now it has pleased you to
bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you:
for you, Yahweh, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.
<p> <a name="C18V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:1</font></a> After this it
happened, that David struck the Philistines, and subdued them, and took
Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines.  <a name="C18V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:2</font></a> He struck Moab; and the Moabites
became servants to David, and brought tribute.  <a name="C18V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:3</font></a> David struck Hadadezer king of
Zobah to Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river
Euphrates.  <a name="C18V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:4</font></a> David took
from him one thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty
thousand footmen; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved
of them for one hundred chariots.  <a name="C18V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:5</font></a> When the Syrians of Damascus came
to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck of the Syrians twenty-two
thousand men.  <a name="C18V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:6</font></a> Then David
put <I>garrisons</I> in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants
to David, and brought tribute. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he
went.  <a name="C18V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:7</font></a> David took the
shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them
to Jerusalem.  <a name="C18V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:8</font></a> From
Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took very much brass,
with which Solomon made the bronze sea, and the pillars, and the vessels
of brass.  <a name="C18V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:9</font></a> When Tou king
of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer king of
Zobah,  <a name="C18V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:10</font></a> he sent Hadoram
his son to king David, to Greet him, and to bless him, because he had
fought against Hadadezer and struck him; (for Hadadezer had wars with
Tou;) and <I>he had with him</I> all manner of vessels of gold and silver
and brass.  <a name="C18V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:11</font></a> These also
did king David dedicate to Yahweh, with the silver and the gold that he
carried away from all the nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the
children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.  <a name="C18V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:12</font></a> Moreover Abishai the son of
Zeruiah struck of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt eighteen thousand.
 <a name="C18V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:13</font></a> He put garrisons in
Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to David. Yahweh gave victory
to David wherever he went.  <a name="C18V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:14</font></a> David reigned over all Israel;
and he executed justice and righteousness to all his people.  <a name="C18V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:15</font></a> Joab the son of Zeruiah was over
the army; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;  <a name="C18V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:16</font></a> and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and
Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Shavsha was scribe;
 <a name="C18V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:17</font></a> and Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of
David were chief about the king.
<p> <a name="C19V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:1</font></a> It happened after
this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son
reigned in his place.  <a name="C19V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:2</font></a> David said, I will show kindness
to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. So
David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. David's
servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort
him.  <a name="C19V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:3</font></a> But the princes of
the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Think you that David does honor your
father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Aren't his servants come to
you to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?  <a name="C19V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:4</font></a> So Hanun took David's servants,
and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their
buttocks, and sent them away.  <a name="C19V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:5</font></a> Then there went certain persons,
and told David how the men were served. He sent to meet them; for the men
were greatly ashamed. The king said, Stay at Jericho until your beards are
grown, and then return.  <a name="C19V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:6</font></a> When the children of Ammon saw
that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of
Ammon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and
horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Arammaacah, and out of Zobah.
 <a name="C19V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:7</font></a> So they hired them
thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who
came and encamped before Medeba. The children of Ammon gathered themselves
together from their cities, and came to battle.  <a name="C19V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:8</font></a> When David heard of it, he sent
Joab, and all the army of the mighty men.  <a name="C19V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:9</font></a> The children of Ammon came out,
and put the battle in array at the gate of the city: and the kings who had
come were by themselves in the field.  <a name="C19V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:10</font></a> Now when Joab saw that the
battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice
men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.  <a name="C19V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:11</font></a> The rest of the people he
committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in
array against the children of Ammon.  <a name="C19V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:12</font></a> He said, If the Syrians are too
strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the children of Ammon are
too strong for you, then I will help you.  <a name="C19V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:13</font></a> Be of good courage, and let us
be strong for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Yahweh do
that which seems him good.  <a name="C19V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:14</font></a> So Joab and the people who were
with him drew near before the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before
him.  <a name="C19V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:15</font></a> When the children
of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai
his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
 <a name="C19V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:16</font></a> When the Syrians saw
that they were defeated by Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth
the Syrians who were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the
army of Hadadezer at their head.  <a name="C19V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:17</font></a> It was told David; and he
gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came on
them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the
battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.  <a name="C19V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:18</font></a> The Syrians fled before Israel;
and David killed of the Syrians <I>the men of</I> seven thousand chariots,
and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the army.
 <a name="C19V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:19</font></a> When the servants of
Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with
David, and served him: neither would the Syrians help the children of
Ammon any more.
<p> <a name="C20V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:1</font></a> It happened, at the
time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go out <I>to
battle</I>, that Joab led forth the army, and wasted the country of the
children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at
Jerusalem. Joab struck Rabbah, and overthrew it.  <a name="C20V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:2</font></a> David took the crown of their
king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there
were precious stones in it; and it was set on David's head: and he brought
forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.  <a name="C20V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:3</font></a> He brought forth the people who
were therein, and cut <I>them</I> with saws, and with iron picks, and with
axes. David did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. David and
all the people returned to Jerusalem.  <a name="C20V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:4</font></a> It happened after this, that
there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines: then Sibbecai the
Hushathite killed Sippai, of the sons of the giant; and they were subdued.
 <a name="C20V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:5</font></a> There was again war with
the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of
Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
 <a name="C20V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:6</font></a> There was again war at
Gath, where there was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were
twenty-four, six <I>on each hand</I>, and six <I>on each foot</I>; and he
also was born to the giant.  <a name="C20V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:7</font></a> When he defied Israel, Jonathan
the son of Shimea David's brother killed him.  <a name="C20V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:8</font></a> These were born to the giant in
Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
<p> <a name="C21V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:1</font></a> Satan stood up against
Israel, and moved David to number Israel.  <a name="C21V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:2</font></a> David said to Joab and to the
princes of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and
bring me word, that I may know the sum of them.  <a name="C21V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:3</font></a> Joab said, Yahweh make his people
a hundred times as many as they are: but, my lord the king, aren't they
all my lord's servants? Why does my lord require this thing? Why will he
be a cause of guilt to Israel?  <a name="C21V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:4</font></a> Nevertheless the king's word
prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed, and went throughout all
Israel, and came to Jerusalem.  <a name="C21V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:5</font></a> Joab gave up the sum of the
numbering of the people to David. All those of Israel were one million one
hundred thousand men who drew sword: and in Judah were four hundred
seventy thousand men who drew sword.  <a name="C21V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:6</font></a> But he didn't count Levi and
Benjamin among them; for the king's word was abominable to Joab.  <a name="C21V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:7</font></a> God was displeased with this
thing; therefore he struck Israel.  <a name="C21V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:8</font></a> David said to God, I have sinned
greatly, in that I have done this thing: but now, put away, I beg you, the
iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.  <a name="C21V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:9</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Gad, David's
seer, saying,  <a name="C21V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:10</font></a> Go and
speak to David, saying, Thus says Yahweh, I offer you three things: choose
one of them, that I may do it to you.  <a name="C21V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:11</font></a> So Gad came to David, and said
to him, Thus says Yahweh, Take your choice:  <a name="C21V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:12</font></a> either three years of famine; or
three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your
enemies overtakes you; or else three days the sword of Yahweh, even
pestilence in the land, and the angel of Yahweh destroying throughout all
the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return
to him who sent me.  <a name="C21V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:13</font></a> David said to Gad, I am in
distress. Let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Yahweh; for very great are
his mercies: and let me not fall into the hand of man.  <a name="C21V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:14</font></a> So Yahweh sent a pestilence on
Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.  <a name="C21V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:15</font></a> God sent an angel to Jerusalem
to destroy it: and as he was about to destroy, Yahweh saw, and he relented
of the disaster, and said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now stay
your hand. The angel of Yahweh was standing by the threshing floor of
Ornan the Jebusite.  <a name="C21V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:16</font></a> David lifted up his eyes, and
saw the angel of Yahweh standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn
sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders,
clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.  <a name="C21V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:17</font></a> David said to God, Isn't it I
who commanded the people to be numbered? It is even I who have sinned and
done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your
hand, O Yahweh my God, be against me, and against my father's house; but
not against your people, that they should be plagued.  <a name="C21V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:18</font></a> Then the angel of Yahweh
commanded Gad to tell David, that David should go up, and raise an altar
to Yahweh in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.  <a name="C21V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:19</font></a> David went up at the saying of
Gad, which he spoke in the name of Yahweh.  <a name="C21V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:20</font></a> Ornan turned back, and saw the
angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was
threshing wheat.  <a name="C21V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:21</font></a> As
David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the
threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.
 <a name="C21V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:22</font></a> Then David said to
Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build thereon
an altar to Yahweh: for the full price you shall give it to me, that the
plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.  <a name="C21V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:23</font></a> Ornan said to David, Take it to
yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes:
behold, I give <I>you</I> the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing
instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering; I give it all.
 <a name="C21V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:24</font></a> King David said to
Ornan, No; but I will most certainly buy it for the full price: for I will
not take that which is yours for Yahweh, nor offer a burnt offering
without cost.  <a name="C21V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:25</font></a> So David
gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.  <a name="C21V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:26</font></a> David built there an altar to
Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on
Yahweh; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt
offering.  <a name="C21V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:27</font></a> Yahweh
commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into its sheath.
 <a name="C21V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:28</font></a> At that time, when David
saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the
Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.  <a name="C21V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:29</font></a> For the tent of Yahweh, which
Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at
that time in the high place at Gibeon.  <a name="C21V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:30</font></a> But David couldn't go before it
to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of
Yahweh.
<p> <a name="C22V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:1</font></a> Then David said, This
is the house of Yahweh God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for
Israel.  <a name="C22V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:2</font></a> David commanded
to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel; and he
set masons to cut worked stones to build the house of God.  <a name="C22V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:3</font></a> David prepared iron in abundance
for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and brass
in abundance without weight;  <a name="C22V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:4</font></a> and cedar trees without number:
for the Sidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to
David.  <a name="C22V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:5</font></a> David said,
Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for
Yahweh must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout
all countries: I will therefore make preparation for it. So David prepared
abundantly before his death.  <a name="C22V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:6</font></a> Then he called for Solomon his
son, and commanded him to build a house for Yahweh, the God of Israel.
 <a name="C22V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:7</font></a> David said to Solomon his
son, As for me, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Yahweh
my God.  <a name="C22V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:8</font></a> But the word of
Yahweh came to me, saying, You have shed blood abundantly, and have made
great wars: you shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed
much blood on the earth in my sight.  <a name="C22V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:9</font></a> Behold, a son shall be born to
you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his
enemies all around; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace
and quietness to Israel in his days:  <a name="C22V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:10</font></a> he shall build a house for my
name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will
establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.  <a name="C22V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:11</font></a> Now, my son, Yahweh be with you;
and prosper you, and build the house of Yahweh your God, as he has spoken
concerning you.  <a name="C22V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:12</font></a> May
Yahweh give you discretion and understanding, and put you in charge of
Israel; that so you may keep the law of Yahweh your God.  <a name="C22V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:13</font></a> Then you shall prosper, if you
observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Yahweh gave Moses
concerning Israel. Be strong, and of good courage. Don't be afraid,
neither be dismayed.  <a name="C22V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:14</font></a> Now, behold, in my affliction I
have prepared for the house of Yahweh one hundred thousand talents of
gold, and one million talents of silver, and of brass and iron without
weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and
you may add to them.  <a name="C22V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:15</font></a> There are also workmen with you
in abundance, cutters and workers of stone and timber, and all kinds of
men who are skillful in every kind of work:  <a name="C22V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:16</font></a> of the gold, the silver, and the
brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and Yahweh be
with you.  <a name="C22V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:17</font></a> David also
commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son,
<I>saying</I>,  <a name="C22V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:18</font></a> Isn't
Yahweh your God with you? Hasn't he given you rest on every side? for he
has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is
subdued before Yahweh, and before his people.  <a name="C22V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:19</font></a> Now set your heart and your soul
to seek after Yahweh your God; arise therefore, and build the sanctuary of
Yahweh God, to bring the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and the holy
vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of Yahweh.
<p> <a name="C23V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:1</font></a> Now David was old and
full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel.  <a name="C23V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:2</font></a> He gathered together all the
princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.  <a name="C23V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:3</font></a> The Levites were numbered from
thirty years old and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man,
was thirty-eight thousand.  <a name="C23V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:4</font></a> Of these, twenty-four thousand
were to oversee the work of the house of Yahweh; and six thousand were
officers and judges;  <a name="C23V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:5</font></a> and
four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised Yahweh with the
instruments which I made, <I>said David</I>, for giving praise.  <a name="C23V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:6</font></a> David divided them into divisions
according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.  <a name="C23V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:7</font></a> Of the Gershonites: Ladan and
Shimei.  <a name="C23V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:8</font></a> The sons of
Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three.  <a name="C23V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:9</font></a> The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth,
and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers'
<I>houses</I> of Ladan.  <a name="C23V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:10</font></a> The sons of Shimei: Jahath,
Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.  <a name="C23V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:11</font></a> Jahath was the chief, and Zizah
the second: but Jeush and Beriah didn't have many sons; therefore they
became a fathers' house in one reckoning.  <a name="C23V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:12</font></a> The sons of Kohath: Amram,
Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.  <a name="C23V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:13</font></a> The sons of Amram: Aaron and
Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy
things, he and his sons, forever, to burn incense before Yahweh, to
minister to him, and to bless in his name, forever.  <a name="C23V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:14</font></a> But as for Moses the man of God,
his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.  <a name="C23V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:15</font></a> The sons of Moses: Gershom and
Eliezer.  <a name="C23V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:16</font></a> The sons of
Gershom: Shebuel the chief.  <a name="C23V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:17</font></a> The sons of Eliezer were:
Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of
Rehabiah were very many.  <a name="C23V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:18</font></a> The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the
chief.  <a name="C23V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:19</font></a> The sons of
Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and
Jekameam the fourth.  <a name="C23V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:20</font></a> The
sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second.  <a name="C23V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:21</font></a> The sons of Merari: Mahli and
Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.  <a name="C23V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:22</font></a> Eleazar died, and had no sons,
but daughters only: and their brothers the sons of Kish took them <I>to
wife</I>.  <a name="C23V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:23</font></a> The sons of
Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.  <a name="C23V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:24</font></a> These were the sons of Levi
after their fathers' houses, even the heads of the fathers' houses of
those who were counted individually, in the number of names by their
polls, who did the work for the service of the house of Yahweh, from
twenty years old and upward.  <a name="C23V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:25</font></a> For David said, Yahweh, the God
of Israel, has given rest to his people; and he dwells in Jerusalem
forever:  <a name="C23V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:26</font></a> and also the
Levites shall no more have need to carry the tent and all its vessels for
its service.  <a name="C23V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:27</font></a> For by the
last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered, from twenty years old
and upward.  <a name="C23V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:28</font></a> For their
office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of
Yahweh, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all
holy things, even the work of the service of the house of God;  <a name="C23V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:29</font></a> for the show bread also, and for
the fine flour for a meal offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of
that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all
manner of measure and size;  <a name="C23V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:30</font></a> and to stand every morning to
thank and praise Yahweh, and likewise in the evening;  <a name="C23V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:31</font></a> and to offer all burnt offerings
to Yahweh, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in
number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually before
Yahweh;  <a name="C23V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:32</font></a> and that they
should keep the duty of the Tent of Meeting, and the duty of the holy
place, and the duty of the sons of Aaron their brothers, for the service
of the house of Yahweh.
<p> <a name="C24V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:1</font></a> These were the
divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron: Nadab and Abihu,
Eleazar and Ithamar.  <a name="C24V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:2</font></a> But
Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore
Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office.  <a name="C24V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:3</font></a> David with Zadok of the sons of
Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to
their ordering in their service.  <a name="C24V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:4</font></a> There were more chief men found
of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and <I>thus</I> were
they divided: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers'
houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers' houses,
eight.  <a name="C24V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:5</font></a> Thus were they
divided impartially by drawing lots; for there were princes of the
sanctuary, and princes of God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the
sons of Ithamar.  <a name="C24V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:6</font></a> Shemaiah
the son of Nethanel the scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the
presence of the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech
the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers' <I>houses</I> of the
priests and of the Levites; one fathers' house being taken for Eleazar,
and one taken for Ithamar.  <a name="C24V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:7</font></a> Now the first lot came forth to
Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,  <a name="C24V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:8</font></a> the third to Harim, the fourth to
Seorim,  <a name="C24V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:9</font></a> the fifth to
Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,  <a name="C24V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:10</font></a> the seventh to Hakkoz, the
eighth to Abijah,  <a name="C24V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:11</font></a> the
ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,  <a name="C24V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:12</font></a> the eleventh to Eliashib, the
twelfth to Jakim,  <a name="C24V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:13</font></a> the
thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,  <a name="C24V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:14</font></a> the fifteenth to Bilgah, the
sixteenth to Immer,  <a name="C24V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:15</font></a> the
seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,  <a name="C24V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:16</font></a> the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the
twentieth to Jehezkel,  <a name="C24V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:17</font></a> the twenty-first to Jachin, the
twenty-second to Gamul,  <a name="C24V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:18</font></a> the twenty-third to Delaiah, the
twenty-fourth to Maaziah.  <a name="C24V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:19</font></a> This was the ordering of them in
their service, to come into the house of Yahweh according to the ordinance
<I>given</I> to them by Aaron their father, as Yahweh, the God of Israel,
had commanded him.  <a name="C24V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:20</font></a> Of
the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons
of Shubael, Jehdeiah.  <a name="C24V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:21</font></a> Of
Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief.  <a name="C24V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:22</font></a> Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of
the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath.  <a name="C24V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:23</font></a> The sons <I>of Hebron</I>:
Jeriah <I>the chief</I>, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam
the fourth.  <a name="C24V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:24</font></a> The sons of
Uzziel, Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir.  <a name="C24V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:25</font></a> The brother of Micah, Isshiah;
of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah.  <a name="C24V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:26</font></a> The sons of Merari: Mahli and
Mushi; the sons of Jaaziah: Beno.  <a name="C24V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:27</font></a> The sons of Merari: of Jaaziah,
Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri.  <a name="C24V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:28</font></a> Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no
sons.  <a name="C24V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:29</font></a> Of Kish; the sons
of Kish: Jerahmeel.  <a name="C24V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:30</font></a> The
sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the
Levites after their fathers' houses.  <a name="C24V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:31</font></a> These likewise cast lots even as
their brothers the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and
Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers' <I>houses</I> of the
priests and of the Levites; the fathers' <I>houses</I> of the chief even
as those of his younger brother.
<p> <a name="C25V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:1</font></a> Moreover, David and
the captains of the army set apart for the service certain of the sons of
Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with
stringed instruments, and with cymbals: and the number of those who did
the work according to their service was:  <a name="C25V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:2</font></a> of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, and
Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asharelah, the sons of Asaph, under the hand of
Asaph, who prophesied after the order of the king.  <a name="C25V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:3</font></a> Of Jeduthun; the sons of
Jeduthun: Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah,
six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun with the harp, who
prophesied in giving thanks and praising Yahweh.  <a name="C25V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:4</font></a> Of Heman; the sons of Heman:
Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani,
Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamti-Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir,
Mahazioth.  <a name="C25V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:5</font></a> All these were
the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words of God, to lift up the
horn. God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.  <a name="C25V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:6</font></a> All these were under the hands of
their father for song in the house of Yahweh, with cymbals, stringed
instruments, and harps, for the service of the house of God; Asaph,
Jeduthun, and Heman being under the order of the king.  <a name="C25V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:7</font></a> The number of them, with their
brothers who were instructed in singing to Yahweh, even all who were
skillful, was two hundred eighty-eight.  <a name="C25V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:8</font></a> They cast lots for their offices,
all alike, as well the small as the great, the teacher as the scholar.
 <a name="C25V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:9</font></a> Now the first lot came
forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second to Gedaliah; he and his brothers and

<p> <a name="C26V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:1</font></a> For the divisions of
the doorkeepers: of the Korahites, Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the
sons of Asaph.  <a name="C26V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:2</font></a> Meshelemiah had sons: Zechariah
the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the
fourth,  <a name="C26V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:3</font></a> Elam the fifth,

Nethanel the fifth,  <a name="C26V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:5</font></a> Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the
seventh, Peullethai the eighth; for God blessed him.  <a name="C26V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:6</font></a> Also to Shemaiah his son were
sons born, who ruled over the house of their father; for they were mighty
men of valor.  <a name="C26V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:7</font></a> The sons of
Shemaiah: Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad, whose brothers were

for the service; sixty-two of Obed-Edom.  <a name="C26V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:9</font></a> Meshelemiah had sons and
brothers, valiant men, eighteen.  <a name="C26V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:10</font></a> Also Hosah, of the children of
Merari, had sons: Shimri the chief, (for though he was not the firstborn,
yet his father made him chief),  <a name="C26V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:11</font></a> Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the
third, Zechariah the fourth: all the sons and brothers of Hosah were
thirteen.  <a name="C26V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:12</font></a> Of these were
the divisions of the doorkeepers, even of the chief men, having offices
like their brothers, to minister in the house of Yahweh.  <a name="C26V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:13</font></a> They cast lots, the small as
well as the great, according to their fathers' houses, for every gate.
 <a name="C26V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:14</font></a> The lot eastward fell to
Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counselor, they cast lots;
and his lot came out northward.  <a name="C26V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:15</font></a> To Obed-Edom southward; and to
his sons the storehouse.  <a name="C26V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:16</font></a> To Shuppim and Hosah westward,
by the gate of Shallecheth, at the causeway that goes up, watch against

Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day, and for the

doorkeepers; of the sons of the Korahites, and of the sons of Merari.
 <a name="C26V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:20</font></a> Of the Levites, Ahijah
was over the treasures of the house of God, and over the treasures of the
dedicated things.  <a name="C26V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:21</font></a> The
sons of Ladan, the sons of the Gershonites belonging to Ladan, the heads
of the fathers' <I>houses</I> belonging to Ladan the Gershonite: Jehieli.
 <a name="C26V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:22</font></a> The sons of Jehieli:
Zetham, and Joel his brother, over the treasures of the house of Yahweh.
 <a name="C26V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:23</font></a> Of the Amramites, of the
Izharites, of the Hebronites, of the Uzzielites:  <a name="C26V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:24</font></a> and Shebuel the son of Gershom,
the son of Moses, was ruler over the treasures.  <a name="C26V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:25</font></a> His brothers: of Eliezer
<I>came</I> Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and
Zichri his son, and Shelomoth his son.  <a name="C26V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:26</font></a> This Shelomoth and his brothers
were over all the treasures of the dedicated things, which David the king,
and the heads of the fathers' <I>houses</I>, the captains over thousands
and hundreds, and the captains of the army, had dedicated.  <a name="C26V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:27</font></a> Out of the spoil won in battles
did they dedicate to repair the house of Yahweh.  <a name="C26V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:28</font></a> All that Samuel the seer, and
Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of
Zeruiah, had dedicated, whoever had dedicated anything, it was under the
hand of Shelomoth, and of his brothers.  <a name="C26V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:29</font></a> Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and
his sons were for the outward business over Israel, for officers and
judges.  <a name="C26V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:30</font></a> Of the
Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brothers, men of valor, one thousand seven
hundred, had the oversight of Israel beyond the Jordan westward, for all
the business of Yahweh, and for the service of the king.  <a name="C26V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:31</font></a> Of the Hebronites was Jerijah
the chief, even of the Hebronites, according to their generations by
fathers' <I>houses</I>. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they
were sought for, and there were found among them mighty men of valor at
Jazer of Gilead.  <a name="C26V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:32</font></a> His
brothers, men of valor, were two thousand seven hundred, heads of fathers'
<I>houses</I>, whom king David made overseers over the Reubenites, and the
Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Manassites, for every matter pertaining
to God, and for the affairs of the king.
<p> <a name="C27V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:1</font></a> Now the children of
Israel after their number, the heads of fathers' <I>houses</I> and the
captains of thousands and of hundreds, and their officers who served the
king, in any matter of the divisions which came in and went out month by
month throughout all the months of the year--of every division were
twenty-four thousand.  <a name="C27V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:2</font></a> Over the first division for the
first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel: and in his division were
twenty-four thousand.  <a name="C27V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:3</font></a> <I>He was</I> of the children of

of them from twenty years old and under, because Yahweh had said he would
increase Israel like the stars of the sky.  <a name="C27V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:24</font></a> Joab the son of Zeruiah began to
number, but didn't finish; and there came wrath for this on Israel;
neither was the number put into the account in the chronicles of king
David.  <a name="C27V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:25</font></a> Over the king's

counselor: and Hushai the Archite was the king's friend:  <a name="C27V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:34</font></a> and after Ahithophel was
Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the captain of the king's
army was Joab.
<p> <a name="C28V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:1</font></a> David assembled all
the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the
companies who served the king by division, and the captains of thousands,
and the captains of hundreds, and the rulers over all the substance and
possessions of the king and of his sons, with the officers, and the mighty
men, even all the mighty men of valor, to Jerusalem.  <a name="C28V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:2</font></a> Then David the king stood up on
his feet, and said, Hear me, my brothers, and my people: as for me, it was
in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of
Yahweh, and for the footstool of our God; and I had made ready for the
building.  <a name="C28V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:3</font></a> But God said to
me, You shall not build a house for my name, because you are a man of war,
and have shed blood.  <a name="C28V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:4</font></a> However Yahweh, the God of
Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel
forever: for he has chosen Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah,
the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure
in me to make me king over all Israel;  <a name="C28V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:5</font></a> Of all my sons (for Yahweh has
given me many sons), he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of
the kingdom of Yahweh over Israel.  <a name="C28V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:6</font></a> He said to me, Solomon your son,
he shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son,
and I will be his father.  <a name="C28V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:7</font></a> I will establish his kingdom
forever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my ordinances, as at
this day.  <a name="C28V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:8</font></a> Now therefore,
in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of Yahweh, and in the audience of
our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of Yahweh your God;
that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to
your children after you forever.  <a name="C28V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:9</font></a> You, Solomon my son, know the God
of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing
mind; for Yahweh searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations
of the thoughts: if you seek him, he will be found of you; but if you
forsake him, he will cast you off forever.  <a name="C28V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:10</font></a> Take heed now; for Yahweh has
chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.
 <a name="C28V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:11</font></a> Then David gave to
Solomon his son the pattern of the porch <I>of the temple</I>, and of its
houses, and of its treasuries, and of the upper rooms of it, and of the
inner chambers of it, and of the place of the mercy seat;  <a name="C28V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:12</font></a> and the pattern of all that he
had by the Spirit, for the courts of the house of Yahweh, and for all the
surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of the house of God, and for the
treasuries of the dedicated things;  <a name="C28V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:13</font></a> also for the divisions of the
priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house
of Yahweh, and for all the vessels of service in the house of Yahweh;
 <a name="C28V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:14</font></a> of gold by weight for
the <I>vessels of</I> gold, for all vessels of every kind of service;
<I>of silver</I> for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all vessels
of every kind of service;  <a name="C28V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:15</font></a> by weight also for the
lampstands of gold, and for its lamps, of gold, by weight for every
lampstand and for its lamps; and for the lampstands of silver,
<I>silver</I> by weight for <I>every</I> lampstand and for its lamps,
according to the use of every lampstand;  <a name="C28V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:16</font></a> and the gold by weight for the
tables of show bread, for every table; and silver for the tables of
silver;  <a name="C28V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:17</font></a> and the forks,
and the basins, and the cups, of pure gold; and for the golden bowls by
weight for every bowl; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl;
 <a name="C28V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:18</font></a> and for the altar of
incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot,
<I>even</I> the cherubim, that spread out <I>their wings</I>, and covered
the ark of the covenant of Yahweh.  <a name="C28V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:19</font></a> All this, <I>said David</I>,
have I been made to understand in writing from the hand of Yahweh, even
all the works of this pattern.  <a name="C28V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:20</font></a> David said to Solomon his son,
Be strong and of good courage, and do it: don't be afraid, nor be
dismayed; for Yahweh God, even my God, is with you; he will not fail you,
nor forsake you, until all the work for the service of the house of Yahweh
is finished.  <a name="C28V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:21</font></a> Behold,
there are the divisions of the priests and the Levites, for all the
service of the house of God: and there shall be with you in all manner of
work every willing man who has skill, for any manner of service: also the
captains and all the people will be entirely at your command.
<p> <a name="C29V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:1</font></a> David the king said to
all the assembly, Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young
and tender, and the work is great; for the palace is not for man, but for
Yahweh God.  <a name="C29V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:2</font></a> Now I have
prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for the
<I>things of</I> gold, and the silver for the <I>things of</I> silver, and
the brass for the <I>things of</I> brass, the iron for the <I>things
of</I> iron, and wood for the <I>things of</I> wood; onyx stones, and
<I>stones</I> to be set, stones for inlaid work, and of various colors,
and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.  <a name="C29V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:3</font></a> In addition, because I have set
my affection on the house of my God, seeing that I have a treasure of my
own of gold and silver, I give it to the house of my God, over and above
all that I have prepared for the holy house,  <a name="C29V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:4</font></a> even three thousand talents of
gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver,
with which to overlay the walls of the houses;  <a name="C29V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:5</font></a> of gold for the <I>things of</I>
gold, and of silver for the <I>things of</I> silver, and for all manner of
work <I>to be made</I> by the hands of artificers. Who then offers
willingly to consecrate himself this day to Yahweh?  <a name="C29V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:6</font></a> Then the princes of the fathers'
<I>houses</I>, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains
of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king's work,
offered willingly;  <a name="C29V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:7</font></a> and
they gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand
talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten thousand talents, and
of brass eighteen thousand talents, and of iron a hundred thousand
talents.  <a name="C29V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:8</font></a> They with whom
<I>precious</I> stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house
of Yahweh, under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.  <a name="C29V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:9</font></a> Then the people rejoiced, because
they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered
willingly to Yahweh: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.
 <a name="C29V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:10</font></a> Therefore David blessed
Yahweh before all the assembly; and David said, You are blessed, Yahweh,
the God of Israel our father, forever and ever.  <a name="C29V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:11</font></a> Yours, Yahweh, is the greatness,
the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the
heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, Yahweh, and you
are exalted as head above all.  <a name="C29V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:12</font></a> Both riches and honor come of
you, and you rule over all; and in your hand is power and might; and it is
in your hand to make great, and to give strength to all.  <a name="C29V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:13</font></a> Now therefore, our God, we thank
you, and praise your glorious name.  <a name="C29V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:14</font></a> But who am I, and what is my
people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For all
things come of you, and of your own have we given you.  <a name="C29V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:15</font></a> For we are strangers before you,
and foreigners, as all our fathers were: our days on the earth are as a
shadow, and there is no abiding.  <a name="C29V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:16</font></a> Yahweh our God, all this store
that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes of
your hand, and is all your own.  <a name="C29V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:17</font></a> I know also, my God, that you
try the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the
uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now
have I seen with joy your people, that are present here, offer willingly
to you.  <a name="C29V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:18</font></a> Yahweh, the God
of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the
imagination of the thoughts of the heart of your people, and prepare their
heart to you;  <a name="C29V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:19</font></a> and give
to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep your commandments, your
testimonies, and your statutes, and to do all these things, and to build
the palace, for which I have made provision.  <a name="C29V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:20</font></a> David said to all the assembly,
Now bless Yahweh your God. All the assembly blessed Yahweh, the God of
their fathers, and bowed down their heads and prostrated themselves before
Yahweh and the king.  <a name="C29V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:21</font></a> They sacrificed sacrifices to
Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings to Yahweh, on the next day after that
day, even one thousand bulls, one thousand rams, and one thousand lambs,
with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel,
 <a name="C29V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:22</font></a> and ate and drink before
Yahweh on that day with great gladness. They made Solomon the son of David
king the second time, and anointed him to Yahweh to be prince, and Zadok
to be priest.  <a name="C29V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:23</font></a> Then
Solomon sat on the throne of Yahweh as king instead of David his father,
and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.  <a name="C29V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:24</font></a> All the princes, the mighty men,
and also all of the sons of king David submitted themselves to Solomon the
king.  <a name="C29V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:25</font></a> Yahweh magnified
Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed on him such
royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.  <a name="C29V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:26</font></a> Now David the son of Jesse
reigned over all Israel.  <a name="C29V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:27</font></a> The time that he reigned over
Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and thirty-three
<I>years</I> reigned he in Jerusalem.  <a name="C29V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:28</font></a> He died in a good old age, full
of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his place.
 <a name="C29V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:29</font></a> Now the acts of David
the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of
Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the
history of Gad the seer,  <a name="C29V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:30</font></a> with all his reign and his
might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the
kingdoms of the countries.

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>
