<h1>
John's First Letter
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> That which was from the
beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our
eyes, that which we saw, and our hands touched, concerning the Word of
life  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> (and the life was
revealed, and we have seen, and testify, and declare to you the life, the
eternal life, which was with the Father, and was revealed to us);  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> that which we have seen and heard
we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with us. Yes, and our
fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son, Jesus Christ.  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> And we write these things to you,
that our joy may be fulfilled.
<p> <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> This is the message
which we have heard from him and announce to you, that God is light, and
in him is no darkness at all.  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> If we say that we have fellowship
with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and don't tell the truth.
 <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> But if we walk in the
light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the
blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> If we say that we have no sin, we
deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> If we confess our sins, he is
faithful and righteous to forgive us the sins, and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness.  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> If we
say that we haven't sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> My little children, I
write these things to you so that you may not sin. If anyone sins, we have
a <a href="#N1">Counselor</a> with the Father, Jesus Christ, the
righteous.  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> And he is the
<a href="#N2">atoning sacrifice</a> for our sins, and not for ours only,
but also for the whole world.  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> This is how we know that we know
him: if we keep his commandments.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> One who says, &quot;I know
him,&quot; and doesn't keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth
isn't in him.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> But whoever
keeps his word, God's love has most certainly been perfected in him. This
is how we know that we are in him:  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> he who says he remains in him
ought himself also to walk just like he walked.
<p> <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> Brothers, I write no
new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the
beginning. The old commandment is the word which you heard from the
beginning.  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> Again, I write
a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you; because the
darkness is passing away, and the true light already shines.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> He who says he is in the light and
hates his brother, is in the darkness even until now.  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> He who loves his brother remains
in the light, and there is no occasion for stumbling in him.  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> But he who hates his brother is
in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and doesn't know where he is
going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
<p> <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> I write to you, little
children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.
<p> <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> I write to you,
fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning.
<p>I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one.
<p>I write to you, little children, because you know the Father.
<p> <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> I have written to you,
fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning.
<p>I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word
of God remains in you, and you have overcome the evil one.
<p> <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> Don't love the world,
neither the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the
Father's love isn't in him.  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> For all that is in the world, the
lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, isn't the
Father's, but is the world's.  <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> The world is passing away with
its lusts, but he who does God's will remains forever.
<p> <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> Little children, these
are the end times, and as you heard that the Antichrist is coming, even
now many antichrists have arisen. By this we know that it is the final
hour.  <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> They went out from
us, but they didn't belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they
would have continued with us. But they left, that they might be revealed
that none of them belong to us.  <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> You have an anointing from the
Holy One, and you know the truth.  <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> I have not written to you because
you don't know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is
of the truth.  <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> Who is the
liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the Antichrist,
he who denies the Father and the Son.  <a name="C2V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:23</font></a> Whoever denies the Son, the same
doesn't have the Father. He who confesses the Son has the Father also.
<p> <a name="C2V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:24</font></a> Therefore, as for you,
let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning. If that which
you heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the
Son, and in the Father.  <a name="C2V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:25</font></a> This is the promise which he
promised us, the eternal life.  <a name="C2V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:26</font></a> These things I have written to
you concerning those who would lead you astray.  <a name="C2V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:27</font></a> As for you, the anointing which
you received from him remains in you, and you don't need for anyone to
teach you. But as his anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is
true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, you will remain in him.
 <a name="C2V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:28</font></a> Now, little children,
remain in him, that when he appears, we may have boldness, and not be
ashamed before him at his coming.  <a name="C2V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:29</font></a> If you know that he is righteous,
you know that everyone who practices righteousness is born of him.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Behold, how great a
love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of
God! For this cause the world doesn't know us, because it didn't know him.
 <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> Beloved, now we are
children of God, and it is not yet revealed what we will be. But we know
that, when he is revealed, we will be like him; for we will see him just
as he is.  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> Everyone who has
this hope set on him purifies himself, even as he is pure.  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> Everyone who sins also commits
lawlessness. Sin is lawlessness.  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> You know that he was revealed to
take away our sins, and in him is no sin.  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> Whoever remains in him doesn't
sin. Whoever sins hasn't seen him, neither knows him.
<p> <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> Little children, let no
one lead you astray. He who does righteousness is righteous, even as he is
righteous.  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> He who sins is
of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To this
end the Son of God was revealed, that he might destroy the works of the
devil.  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> Whoever is born of
God doesn't commit sin, because his seed remains in him; and he can't sin,
because he is born of God.  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> In this the children of God are
revealed, and the children of the devil. Whoever doesn't do righteousness
is not of God, neither is he who doesn't love his brother.  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> For this is the message which you
heard from the beginning, that we should love one another;  <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> unlike Cain, who was of the evil
one, and killed his brother. Why did he kill him? Because his works were
evil, and his brother's righteous.  <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> Don't be surprised, my brothers,
if the world hates you.  <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> We know that we have passed out
of death into life, because we love the brothers. He who doesn't love his
brother remains in death.  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> Whoever hates his brother is a
murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him.
<p> <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> By this we know love,
because he laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives
for the brothers.  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> But
whoever has the world's goods, and sees his brother in need, and closes
his heart of compassion against him, how does the love of God remain in
him?  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> My little children,
let's not love in word only, neither with the tongue only, but in deed and
truth.  <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> And by this we
know that we are of the truth, and persuade our hearts before him,  <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> because if our heart condemns us,
God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.  <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> Beloved, if our hearts don't
condemn us, we have boldness toward God;  <a name="C3V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:22</font></a> and whatever we ask, we receive
from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are
pleasing in his sight.  <a name="C3V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:23</font></a> This is his commandment, that we
should believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another,
even as he commanded.  <a name="C3V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:24</font></a> He
who keeps his commandments remains in him, and he in him. By this we know
that he remains in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> Beloved, don't believe
every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God, because many
false prophets have gone out into the world.  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> By this you know the Spirit of
God: every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is
of God,  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> and every spirit
who doesn't confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God,
and this is the spirit of the antichrist, of whom you have heard that it
comes. Now it is in the world already.  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> You are of God, little children,
and have overcome them; because greater is he who is in you than he who is
in the world.  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> They are of
the world. Therefore they speak of the world, and the world hears them.
 <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> We are of God. He who
knows God listens to us. He who is not of God doesn't listen to us. By
this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
<p> <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> Beloved, let us love
one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God,
and knows God.  <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> He who
doesn't love doesn't know God, for God is love.  <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> By this God's love was revealed in
us, that God has sent his one and only Son into the world that we might
live through him.  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> In this
is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son as
the <a href="#N3">atoning sacrifice</a> for our sins.  <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> Beloved, if God loved us in this
way, we also ought to love one another.  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> No one has seen God at any time.
If we love one another, God remains in us, and his love has been perfected
in us.
<p> <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> By this we know that
we remain in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.
 <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> We have seen and testify
that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world.  <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> Whoever confesses that Jesus is
the Son of God, God remains in him, and he in God.  <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> We know and have believed the
love which God has for us. God is love, and he who remains in love remains
in God, and God remains in him.  <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> In this love has been made
perfect among us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment,
because as he is, even so are we in this world.  <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> There is no fear in love; but
perfect love casts out fear, because fear has punishment. He who fears is
not made perfect in love.  <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> We love Him, because he first
loved us.  <a name="C4V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:20</font></a> If a man says,
&quot;I love God,&quot; and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who
doesn't love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has
not seen?  <a name="C4V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:21</font></a> This
commandment we have from him, that he who loves God should also love his
brother.
<p> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> Whoever believes that
Jesus is the Christ is born of God. Whoever loves the father also loves
the child who is born of him.  <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> By this we know that we love the
children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments.  <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> For this is the love of God, that
we keep his commandments. His commandments are not grievous.  <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> For whatever is born of God
overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world: your
faith.  <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> Who is he who
overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
 <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> This is he who came by
water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water
and the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the
truth.  <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> For there are three
who testify<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N4">*</a></sup></font>:  <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> the Spirit, the water, and the
blood; and the three agree as one.  <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> If we receive the witness of men,
the witness of God is greater; for this is God's testimony which he has
testified concerning his Son.  <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> He who believes in the Son of God
has the testimony in himself. He who doesn't believe God has made him a
liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given
concerning his Son.  <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> The
testimony is this, that God gave to us eternal life, and this life is in
his Son.  <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> He who has the
Son has the life. He who doesn't have God's Son doesn't have the life.
 <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> These things I have
written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may
know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in
the name of the Son of God.
<p> <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> This is the boldness
which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will,
he listens to us.  <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> And if
we know that he listens to us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the
petitions which we have asked of him.
<p> <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> If anyone sees his
brother sinning a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will
give him life for those who sin not leading to death. There is a sin
leading to death. I don't say that he should make a request concerning
this.  <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> All unrighteousness
is sin, and there is a sin not leading to death.  <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> We know that whoever is born of
God doesn't sin, but he who was born of God keeps himself, and the evil
one doesn't touch him.  <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> We
know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil
one.  <a name="C5V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:20</font></a> We know that the Son
of God has come, and has given us an understanding, that we know him who
is true, and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is
the true God, and eternal life.
<p> <a name="C5V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:21</font></a> Little children, keep
yourselves from idols.

Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.</p>

<p>In answer to various questions we have received on this:</p>

<p>We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally<br>
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.<br>
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with<br>
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from<br>
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our<br>
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth<br>
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
