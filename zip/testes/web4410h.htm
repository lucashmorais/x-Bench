<h1>
The Acts of the Apostles
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> The first book I wrote,
Theophilus, concerned all that Jesus began both to do and to teach,
 <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> until the day in which he
was received up, after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to
the apostles whom he had chosen.  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> To these he also showed himself
alive after he suffered, by many proofs, appearing to them over a period
of forty days, and speaking about God's Kingdom.  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> Being assembled together with
them, he commanded them, &quot;Don't depart from
Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which you heard from
me.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> For John indeed
baptized in water, but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many
days from now.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> Therefore, when they
had come together, they asked him, &quot;Lord, are you now restoring the
kingdom to Israel?&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> He said to them, &quot;It isn't for you to know times or seasons which the Father
has set within his own authority.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> But you will receive power when
the Holy Spirit has come upon you. You will be witnesses to me in
Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the uttermost parts of the
earth.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> When he had said these
things, as they were looking, he was taken up, and a cloud received him
out of their sight.  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> While
they were looking steadfastly into the sky as he went, behold, two men
stood by them in white clothing,  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> who also said, &quot;You men of
Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who was
received up from you into the sky will come back in the same way as you
saw him going into the sky.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> Then they returned to
Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a
Sabbath day's journey away.  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> When they had come in, they went
up into the upper room, where they were staying; that is Peter, John,
James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James the son of
Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> All these with one accord
continued steadfastly in prayer and supplication, along with the women,
and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
<p> <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> In these days, Peter
stood up in the midst of the disciples (and the number of names was about
one hundred twenty), and said,  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> &quot;Brothers, it was necessary
that this Scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke
before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was guide to those who
took Jesus.  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> For he was
numbered with us, and received his portion in this ministry.  <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> Now this man obtained a field
with the reward for his wickedness, and falling headlong, his body burst
open, and all his intestines gushed out.  <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> It became known to everyone who
lived in Jerusalem that in their language that field was called
'Akeldama,' that is, 'The field of blood.'  <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> For it is written in the book of
Psalms,
<dl>
<dt>'Let his habitation be made desolate.
<dd>Let no one dwell therein;'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N1">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p>and,
<dl>
<dt>'Let another take his office.'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N2">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> &quot;Of the men
therefore who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in
and out among us,  <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> beginning from the baptism of
John, to the day that he was received up from us, of these one must become
a witness with us of his resurrection.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:23</font></a> They put forward two,
Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.  <a name="C1V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:24</font></a> They prayed, and said, &quot;You,
Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two you have
chosen  <a name="C1V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:25</font></a> to take part in
this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go
to his own place.&quot;  <a name="C1V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:26</font></a> They drew lots for them, and the
lot fell on Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> Now when the day of
Pentecost had come, they were all with one accord in one place.  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> Suddenly there came from the sky a
sound like the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where
they were sitting.  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> Tongues
like fire appeared and were distributed to them, and one sat on each of
them.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> They were all filled
with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other languages, as the
Spirit gave them the ability to speak.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> Now there were dwelling in
Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under the sky.  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> When this sound was heard, the
multitude came together, and were bewildered, because everyone heard them
speaking in his own language.  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> They were all amazed and marveled,
saying to one another, &quot;Behold, aren't all these who speak Galileans?
 <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> How do we hear, everyone
in our own native language?  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and
people from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia,  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, the
parts of Libya around Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews and
proselytes,  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> Cretans and
Arabians: we hear them speaking in our languages the mighty works of
God!&quot;  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> They were all
amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another, &quot;What does this
mean?&quot;  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> Others,
mocking, said, &quot;They are filled with new wine.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> But Peter, standing up
with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke out to them, &quot;You men
of Judea, and all you who dwell at Jerusalem, let this be known to you,
and listen to my words.  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> For these aren't drunken, as you
suppose, seeing it is only <a href="#N3">the third hour of the day</a>.
 <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> But this is what has been
spoken through the prophet Joel:
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> 'It will be in the
last days, says God,
<dd>that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh.
<dt>Your sons and your daughters will prophesy.
<dd>Your young men will see visions.
<dd>Your old men will dream dreams.
<dt> <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> Yes, and on my
servants and on my handmaidens in those days,
<dd>I will pour out my Spirit, and they will prophesy.
<dt> <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> I will show wonders
in the sky above,
<dd>and signs on the earth beneath;
<dd>blood, and fire, and billows of smoke.
<dt> <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> The sun will be
turned into darkness,
<dd>and the moon into blood,
<dd>before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes.
<dd> <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> It will be, that
whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.'<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N4">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> &quot;Men of Israel,
hear these words! Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved by God to you by
mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of
you, even as you yourselves know,  <a name="C2V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:23</font></a> him, being delivered up by the
determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken by the hand of
lawless men, crucified and killed;  <a name="C2V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:24</font></a> whom God raised up, having freed
him from the agony of death, because it was not possible that he should be
held by it.  <a name="C2V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:25</font></a> For David
says concerning him,
<dl>
<dt>'I saw the Lord always before my face,
<dd>For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved.
<dt> <a name="C2V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:26</font></a> Therefore my heart
was glad, and my tongue rejoiced.
<dd>Moreover my flesh also will dwell in hope;
<dt> <a name="C2V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:27</font></a> because you will not
leave my soul in <a href="#N5">Hades</a>,
<dd>neither will you allow your Holy One to see decay.
<dt> <a name="C2V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:28</font></a> You made known to me
the ways of life.
<dd>You will make me full of gladness with your presence.'<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N6">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C2V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:29</font></a> &quot;Brothers, I may
tell you freely of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried,
and his tomb is with us to this day.  <a name="C2V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:30</font></a> Therefore, being a prophet, and
knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his
body, according to the flesh, he would raise up the Christ to sit on his
throne,  <a name="C2V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:31</font></a> he foreseeing
this spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was his soul
left in <a href="#N7">Hades</a>, nor did his flesh see decay.  <a name="C2V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:32</font></a> This Jesus God raised up, to
which we all are witnesses.  <a name="C2V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:33</font></a> Being therefore exalted by the
right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the
Holy Spirit, he has poured out this, which you now see and hear.  <a name="C2V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:34</font></a> For David didn't ascend into the
heavens, but he says himself,
<dl>
<dt>'The Lord said to my Lord, &quot;Sit by my right hand,
<dd> <a name="C2V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:35</font></a> until I make your
enemies a footstool for your feet.&quot;'<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N8">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C2V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:36</font></a> &quot;Let all the
house of Israel therefore know certainly that God has made him both Lord
and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:37</font></a> Now when they heard
this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the
apostles, &quot;Brothers, what shall we do?&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:38</font></a> Peter said to them,
&quot;Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus
Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the
Holy Spirit.  <a name="C2V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:39</font></a> For to you
is the promise, and to your children, and to all who are far off, even as
many as the Lord our God will call to himself.&quot;  <a name="C2V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:40</font></a> With many other words he
testified, and exhorted them, saying, &quot;Save yourselves from this
crooked generation!&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:41</font></a> Then those who gladly
received his word were baptized. There were added that day about three
thousand souls.  <a name="C2V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:42</font></a> They
continued steadfastly in the apostles' teaching and fellowship, in the
breaking of bread, and prayer.  <a name="C2V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:43</font></a> Fear came on every soul, and many
wonders and signs were done through the apostles.  <a name="C2V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:44</font></a> All who believed were together,
and had all things in common.  <a name="C2V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:45</font></a> They sold their possessions and
goods, and distributed them to all, according as anyone had need.  <a name="C2V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:46</font></a> Day by day, continuing
steadfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home,
they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart,  <a name="C2V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:47</font></a> praising God, and having favor
with all the people. The Lord added to the assembly day by day those who
were being saved.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Peter and John were
going up into the temple at the hour of prayer, <a href="#N9">the ninth
hour</a>.  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> A certain man
who was lame from his mother's womb was being carried, whom they laid
daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask gifts
for the needy of those who entered into the temple.  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> Seeing Peter and John about to go
into the temple, he asked to receive gifts for the needy.  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> Peter, fastening his eyes on him,
with John, said, &quot;Look at us.&quot;  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> He listened to them, expecting to
receive something from them.  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> But Peter said, &quot;Silver and
gold have I none, but what I have, that I give you. In the name of Jesus
Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk!&quot;  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> He took him by the right hand, and
raised him up. Immediately his feet and his ankle bones received strength.
 <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> Leaping up, he stood, and
began to walk. He entered with them into the temple, walking, leaping, and
praising God.  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> All the
people saw him walking and praising God.  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> They recognized him, that it was
he who used to sit begging for gifts for the needy at the Beautiful Gate
of the temple. They were filled with wonder and amazement at what had
happened to him.  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> As the
lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John, all the people ran
together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.
<p> <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> When Peter saw it, he
responded to the people, &quot;You men of Israel, why do you marvel at
this man? Why do you fasten your eyes on us, as though by our own power or
godliness we had made him walk?  <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> The God of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Servant Jesus, whom you
delivered up, and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had determined
to release him.  <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> But you
denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted
to you,  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> and killed the
Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead, to which we are witnesses.
 <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> By faith in his name, his
name has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which
is through him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you
all.
<p> <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> &quot;Now, <a
href="#N10">brothers</a>, I know that you did this in ignorance, as did
also your rulers.  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> But the
things which God announced by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ
should suffer, he thus fulfilled.
<p> <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> &quot;Repent
therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, so that
there may come times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord,  <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> and that he may send Christ
Jesus, who was ordained for you before,  <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> whom heaven must receive until
the times of restoration of all things, which God spoke long ago by the
mouth of his holy prophets.  <a name="C3V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:22</font></a> For Moses indeed said to the
fathers, 'The Lord God will raise up a prophet for you from among your
brothers, like me. You shall listen to him in all things whatever he says
to you.  <a name="C3V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:23</font></a> It will be, that
every soul that will not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed
from among the people.'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N11">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C3V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:24</font></a> Yes, and all the prophets from
Samuel and those who followed after, as many as have spoken, they also
told of these days.  <a name="C3V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:25</font></a> You
are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with
our fathers, saying to Abraham, 'In your seed will all the families of the
earth be blessed.'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N12">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C3V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:26</font></a> God, having raised up his
servant, Jesus, sent him to you first, to bless you, in turning away
everyone of you from your wickedness.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> As they spoke to the
people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came
to them,  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> being upset
because they taught the people and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection
from the dead.  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> They laid
hands on them, and put them in custody until the next day, for it was now
evening.  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> But many of those
who heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to be about
five thousand.
<p> <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> It happened in the
morning, that their rulers, elders, and scribes were gathered together in
Jerusalem.  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> Annas the high
priest was there, with Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and as many as were
relatives of the high priest.  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> When they had stood them in the
middle of them, they inquired, &quot;By what power, or in what name, have
you done this?&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> Then Peter, filled with
the Holy Spirit, said to them, &quot;You rulers of the people, and elders
of Israel,  <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> if we are
examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what
means this man has been healed,  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> be it known to you all, and to
all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, in him does this man
stand here before you whole.  <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> He is 'the stone which was
regarded as worthless by you, the builders, which has become the head of
the corner.'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N13">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> There is salvation in none other,
for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men,
by which we must be saved!&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> Now when they saw the
boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and
ignorant men, they marveled. They recognized that they had been with
Jesus.  <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> Seeing the man who
was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.  <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> But when they had commanded them
to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,  <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> saying, &quot;What shall we do to
these men? Because indeed a notable miracle has been done through them, as
can be plainly seen by all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we can't deny it.
 <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> But so that this spreads
no further among the people, let's threaten them, that from now on they
don't speak to anyone in this name.&quot;  <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> They called them, and commanded
them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.
<p> <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> But Peter and John
answered them, &quot;Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to
you rather than to God, judge for yourselves,  <a name="C4V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:20</font></a> for we can't help telling the
things which we saw and heard.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:21</font></a> When they had further
threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because
of the people; for everyone glorified God for that which was done.  <a name="C4V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:22</font></a> For the man on whom this miracle
of healing was performed was more than forty years old.
<p> <a name="C4V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:23</font></a> Being let go, they
came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the
elders had said to them.  <a name="C4V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:24</font></a> When they heard it, they lifted
up their voice to God with one accord, and said, &quot;O Lord, you are
God, who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them;
 <a name="C4V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:25</font></a> who by the mouth of your
servant, David, said,
<dl>
<dt>'Why do the nations rage,
<dd>and the peoples plot a vain thing?
<dt> <a name="C4V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:26</font></a> The kings of the
earth take a stand,
<dd>and the rulers take council together,
<dd>against the Lord, and against his <a href="#N14">Christ</a>.'<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N15">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C4V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:27</font></a> &quot;For truly, in
this city against your holy servant, Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod
and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were
gathered together  <a name="C4V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:28</font></a> to do
whatever your hand and your council foreordained to happen.  <a name="C4V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:29</font></a> Now, Lord, look at their threats,
and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness,  <a name="C4V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:30</font></a> while you stretch out your hand
to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your
holy Servant Jesus.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:31</font></a> When they had prayed,
the place was shaken where they were gathered together. They were all
filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.
 <a name="C4V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:32</font></a> The multitude of those
who believed were of one heart and soul. Not one of them claimed that
anything of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all
things in common.  <a name="C4V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:33</font></a> With
great power, the apostles gave their testimony of the resurrection of the
Lord Jesus. Great grace was on them all.  <a name="C4V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:34</font></a> For neither was there among them
any who lacked, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them,
and brought the proceeds of the things that were sold,  <a name="C4V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:35</font></a> and laid them at the apostles'
feet, and distribution was made to each, according as anyone had need.
 <a name="C4V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:36</font></a> Joses, who by the
apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of
Encouragement), a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race,  <a name="C4V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:37</font></a> having a field, sold it, and
brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.
<p> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> But a certain man named
Ananias, with Sapphira, his wife, sold a possession,  <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> and kept back part of the price,
his wife also being aware of it, and brought a certain part, and laid it
at the apostles' feet.  <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> But
Peter said, &quot;Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the
Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land?  <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> While you kept it, didn't it
remain your own? After it was sold, wasn't it in your power? How is it
that you have conceived this thing in your heart? You haven't lied to men,
but to God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> Ananias, hearing these
words, fell down and died. Great fear came on all who heard these things.
 <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> The young men arose and
wrapped him up, and they carried him out and buried him.  <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> About three hours later, his wife,
not knowing what had happened, came in.  <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> Peter answered her, &quot;Tell me
whether you sold the land for so much.&quot;
<p>She said, &quot;Yes, for so much.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> But Peter asked her,
&quot;How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the
Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the
door, and they will carry you out.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> She fell down
immediately at his feet, and died. The young men came in and found her
dead, and they carried her out and buried her by her husband.  <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> Great fear came on the whole
assembly, and on all who heard these things.  <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> By the hands of the apostles many
signs and wonders were done among the people. They were all with one
accord in Solomon's porch.  <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> None of the rest dared to join
them, however the people honored them.  <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> More believers were added to the
Lord, multitudes of both men and women.  <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> They even carried out the sick
into the streets, and laid them on cots and mattresses, so that as Peter
came by, at the least his shadow might overshadow some of them.  <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> Multitudes also came together
from the cities around Jerusalem, bringing sick people, and those who were
tormented by unclean spirits: and they were all healed.
<p> <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> But the high priest
rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the
Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy,  <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> and laid hands on the apostles,
and put them in public custody.  <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> But an angel of the Lord opened
the prison doors by night, and brought them out, and said,  <a name="C5V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:20</font></a> &quot;Go stand and speak in the
temple to the people all the words of this life.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:21</font></a> When they heard this,
they entered into the temple about daybreak, and taught. But the high
priest came, and those who were with him, and called the council together,
and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to
have them brought.  <a name="C5V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:22</font></a> But
the officers who came didn't find them in the prison. They returned and
reported,  <a name="C5V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:23</font></a> &quot;We found
the prison shut and locked, and the guards standing before the doors, but
when we opened them, we found no one inside!&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:24</font></a> Now when the high
priest, the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these
words, they were very perplexed about them and what might become of this.
 <a name="C5V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:25</font></a> One came and told them,
&quot;Behold, the men whom you put in prison are in the temple, standing
and teaching the people.&quot;  <a name="C5V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:26</font></a> Then the captain went with the
officers, and brought them without violence, for they were afraid that the
people might stone them.
<p> <a name="C5V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:27</font></a> When they had brought
them, they set them before the council. The high priest questioned them,
 <a name="C5V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:28</font></a> saying, &quot;Didn't we
strictly command you not to teach in this name? Behold, you have filled
Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring this man's blood on
us.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:29</font></a> But Peter and the
apostles answered, &quot;We must obey God rather than men.  <a name="C5V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:30</font></a> The God of our fathers raised up
Jesus, whom you killed, hanging him on a tree.  <a name="C5V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:31</font></a> God exalted him with his right
hand to be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and
remission of sins.  <a name="C5V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:32</font></a> We are
His witnesses of these things; and so also is the Holy Spirit, whom God
has given to those who obey him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:33</font></a> But they, when they
heard this, were cut to the heart, and determined to kill them.  <a name="C5V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:34</font></a> But one stood up in the council,
a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, honored by all the
people, and commanded to put the apostles out for a little while.  <a name="C5V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:35</font></a> He said to them, &quot;You men of
Israel, be careful concerning these men, what you are about to do.  <a name="C5V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:36</font></a> For before these days Theudas
rose up, making himself out to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about
four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed
him, were dispersed, and came to nothing.  <a name="C5V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:37</font></a> After this man, Judas of Galilee
rose up in the days of the enrollment, and drew away some people after
him. He also perished, and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered
abroad.  <a name="C5V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:38</font></a> Now I tell you,
withdraw from these men, and leave them alone. For if this counsel or this
work is of men, it will be overthrown.  <a name="C5V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:39</font></a> But if it is of God, you will not
be able to overthrow it, and you would be found even to be fighting
against God!&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:40</font></a> They agreed with him.
Summoning the apostles, they beat them and commanded them not to speak in
the name of Jesus, and let them go.  <a name="C5V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:41</font></a> They therefore departed from the
presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer
dishonor for Jesus' name.
<p> <a name="C5V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:42</font></a> Every day, in the
temple and at home, they never stopped teaching and preaching Jesus, the
Christ.
<p> <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> Now in those days, when
the number of the disciples was multiplying, a complaint arose from the <a
href="#N16">Hellenists</a> against the Hebrews, because their widows were
neglected in the daily service.  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> The twelve summoned the multitude
of the disciples and said, &quot;It is not appropriate for us to forsake
the word of God and serve tables.  <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> Therefore select from among you,
brothers, seven men of good report, full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom,
whom we may appoint over this business.  <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> But we will continue steadfastly
in prayer and in the ministry of the word.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> These words pleased the
whole multitude. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy
Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a
proselyte of Antioch;  <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> whom
they set before the apostles. When they had prayed, they laid their hands
on them.  <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> The word of God
increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem
exceedingly. A great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.
<p> <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> Stephen, full of faith
and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people.  <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> But some of those who were of the
synagogue called &quot;The Libertines,&quot; and of the Cyrenians, of the
Alexandrians, and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose, disputing with
Stephen.  <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> They weren't
able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.  <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> Then they secretly induced men to
say, &quot;We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and
God.&quot;  <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> They stirred
up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and came against him and
seized him, and brought him in to the council,  <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> and set up false witnesses who
said, &quot;This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against this
holy place and the law.  <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> For we have heard him say that
this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the
customs which Moses delivered to us.&quot;  <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> All who sat in the council,
fastening their eyes on him, saw his face like it was the face of an angel.
<p> <a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> The high priest said,
&quot;Are these things so?&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> He said, &quot;Brothers
and fathers, listen. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when
he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,  <a name="C7V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:3</font></a> and said to him, 'Get out of your
land, and from your relatives, and come into a land which I will show
you.'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N17">*</a></sup></font>
 <a name="C7V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:4</font></a> Then he came out of the
land of the Chaldaeans, and lived in Haran. From there, when his father
was dead, God moved him into this land, where you are now living.  <a name="C7V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:5</font></a> He gave him no inheritance in it,
no, not so much as to set his foot on. He promised that he would give it
to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when he still had no
child.  <a name="C7V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:6</font></a> God spoke in this
way: that his seed would live as aliens in a strange land, and that they
would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years.  <a name="C7V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:7</font></a> 'I will judge the nation to which
they will be in bondage,' said God, 'and after that will they come out,
and serve me in this place.'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N18">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C7V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:8</font></a> He gave him the covenant of
circumcision. So Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him
the eighth day. Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the
father of the twelve patriarchs.
<p> <a name="C7V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:9</font></a> &quot;The patriarchs,
moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt. God was with him,
 <a name="C7V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:10</font></a> and delivered him out of
all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of
Egypt. He made him governor over Egypt and all his house.  <a name="C7V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:11</font></a> Now a famine came over all the
land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction. Our fathers found no food.
 <a name="C7V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:12</font></a> But when Jacob heard that
there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers the first time.  <a name="C7V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:13</font></a> On the second time Joseph was
made known to his brothers, and Joseph's race was revealed to Pharaoh.
 <a name="C7V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:14</font></a> Joseph sent, and summoned
Jacob, his father, and all his relatives, seventy-five souls.  <a name="C7V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:15</font></a> Jacob went down into Egypt, and
he died, himself and our fathers,  <a name="C7V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:16</font></a> and they were brought back to
Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver
from the children of Hamor of Shechem.
<p> <a name="C7V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:17</font></a> &quot;But as the time
of the promise came close which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew
and multiplied in Egypt,  <a name="C7V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:18</font></a> until there arose a different
king, who didn't know Joseph.  <a name="C7V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:19</font></a> The same took advantage of our
race, and mistreated our fathers, and forced them to throw out their
babies, so that they wouldn't stay alive.  <a name="C7V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:20</font></a> At that time Moses was born, and
was exceedingly handsome. He was nourished three months in his father's
house.  <a name="C7V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:21</font></a> When he was thrown
out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and reared him as her own son.
 <a name="C7V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:22</font></a> Moses was instructed in
all the wisdom of the Egyptians. He was mighty in his words and works.
 <a name="C7V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:23</font></a> But when he was forty
years old, it came into his heart to visit his <a
href="#N19">brothers</a>, the children of Israel.  <a name="C7V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:24</font></a> Seeing one of them suffer wrong,
he defended him, and avenged him who was oppressed, striking the Egyptian.
 <a name="C7V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:25</font></a> He supposed that his
brothers understood that God, by his hand, was giving them deliverance;
but they didn't understand.
<p> <a name="C7V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:26</font></a> &quot;The day
following, he appeared to them as they fought, and urged them to be at
peace again, saying, 'Sirs, you are brothers. Why do you wrong one
another?'  <a name="C7V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:27</font></a> But he who did
his neighbor wrong pushed him away, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and a
judge over us?  <a name="C7V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:28</font></a> Do you
want to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N20">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C7V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:29</font></a> Moses fled at this saying, and
became a stranger in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two
sons.
<p> <a name="C7V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:30</font></a> &quot;When forty years
were fulfilled, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in the wilderness of
Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.  <a name="C7V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:31</font></a> When Moses saw it, he wondered at
the sight. As he came close to see, a voice of the Lord came to him,
 <a name="C7V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:32</font></a> 'I am the God of your
fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N21">*</a></sup></font> Moses
trembled, and dared not look.  <a name="C7V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:33</font></a> The Lord said to him, 'Take your
sandals off of your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.
 <a name="C7V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:34</font></a> I have surely seen the
affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and have heard their groaning. I
have come down to deliver them. Now come, I will send you into
Egypt.'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N22">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C7V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:35</font></a> &quot;This Moses, whom
they refused, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge?'--God has sent
him as both a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel who appeared
to him in the bush.  <a name="C7V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:36</font></a> This
man led them out, having worked wonders and signs in Egypt, in the Red
Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years.  <a name="C7V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:37</font></a> This is that Moses, who said to
the children of Israel, 'The Lord our God will raise up a prophet for you
from among your brothers, like me.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a

assembly in the wilderness with the angel that spoke to him on Mount
Sinai, and with our fathers, who received living oracles to give to us,
 <a name="C7V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:39</font></a> to whom our fathers
wouldn't be obedient, but rejected him, and turned back in their hearts to
Egypt,  <a name="C7V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:40</font></a> saying to Aaron,
'Make us gods that will go before us, for as for this Moses, who led us
out of the land of Egypt, we don't know what has become of him.'<font

the tent of the testimony in the wilderness, even as he who spoke to Moses
commanded him to make it according to the pattern that he had seen;
 <a name="C7V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:45</font></a> which also our fathers,
in their turn, brought in with Joshua when they entered into the
possession of the nations, whom God drove out before the face of our
fathers, to the days of David,  <a name="C7V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:46</font></a> who found favor in the sight of
God, and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob.  <a name="C7V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:47</font></a> But Solomon built him a house.

<p> <a name="C7V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:51</font></a> &quot;You stiff-necked
and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit! As
your fathers did, so you do.  <a name="C7V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:52</font></a> Which of the prophets didn't your
fathers persecute? They killed those who foretold the coming of the
Righteous One, of whom you have now become betrayers and murderers.
 <a name="C7V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:53</font></a> You received the law as
it was ordained by angels, and didn't keep it!&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:54</font></a> Now when they heard
these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed at him with
their teeth.  <a name="C7V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:55</font></a> But he,
being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw
the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,  <a name="C7V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:56</font></a> and said, &quot;Behold, I see the
heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V57"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:57</font></a> But they cried out
with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed at him with one
accord.  <a name="C7V58"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:58</font></a> They threw him
out of the city, and stoned him. The witnesses placed their garments at
the feet of a young man named Saul.  <a name="C7V59"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:59</font></a> They stoned Stephen as he called
out, saying, &quot;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!&quot;  <a name="C7V60"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:60</font></a> He kneeled down, and cried with a
loud voice, &quot;Lord, don't hold this sin against them!&quot; When he
had said this, he fell asleep.
<p> <a name="C8V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:1</font></a> Saul was consenting to
his death. A great persecution arose against the assembly which was in
Jerusalem in that day. They were all scattered abroad throughout the
regions of Judea and Samaria, except for the apostles.  <a name="C8V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:2</font></a> Devout men buried Stephen, and
lamented greatly over him.  <a name="C8V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:3</font></a> But Saul ravaged the assembly,
entering into every house, and dragged both men and women off to prison.
 <a name="C8V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:4</font></a> Therefore those who were
scattered abroad went around preaching the word.  <a name="C8V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:5</font></a> Philip went down to the city of
Samaria, and proclaimed to them the Christ.  <a name="C8V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:6</font></a> The multitudes listened with one
accord to the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard and saw
the signs which he did.  <a name="C8V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:7</font></a> For unclean spirits came out of
many of those who had them. They came out, crying with a loud voice. Many
who had been paralyzed and lame were healed.  <a name="C8V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:8</font></a> There was great joy in that city.
<p> <a name="C8V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:9</font></a> But there was a certain
man, Simon by name, who used to practice sorcery in the city, and amazed
the people of Samaria, making himself out to be some great one,  <a name="C8V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:10</font></a> to whom they all listened, from
the least to the greatest, saying, &quot;This man is that great power of
God.&quot;  <a name="C8V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:11</font></a> They listened
to him, because for a long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.
 <a name="C8V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:12</font></a> But when they believed
Philip preaching good news concerning the Kingdom of God and the name of
Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.  <a name="C8V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:13</font></a> Simon himself also believed.
Being baptized, he continued with Philip. Seeing signs and great miracles
occurring, he was amazed.
<p> <a name="C8V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:14</font></a> Now when the apostles
who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God,
they sent Peter and John to them,  <a name="C8V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:15</font></a> who, when they had come down,
prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit;  <a name="C8V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:16</font></a> for as yet he had fallen on none
of them. They had only been baptized in the name of Christ Jesus.  <a name="C8V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:17</font></a> Then they laid their hands on
them, and they received the Holy Spirit.  <a name="C8V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:18</font></a> Now when Simon saw that the Holy
Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered
them money,  <a name="C8V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:19</font></a> saying,
&quot;Give me also this power, that whoever I lay my hands on may receive
the Holy Spirit.&quot;  <a name="C8V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:20</font></a> But Peter said to him, &quot;May
your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift
of God with money!  <a name="C8V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:21</font></a> You
have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart isn't right
before God.  <a name="C8V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:22</font></a> Repent
therefore of this, your wickedness, and ask God if perhaps the thought of
your heart may be forgiven you.  <a name="C8V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:23</font></a> For I see that you are in the
gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:24</font></a> Simon answered,
&quot;Pray for me to the Lord, that none of the things which you have
spoken happen to me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:25</font></a> They therefore, when
they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem,
and preached the Good News to many villages of the Samaritans.  <a name="C8V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:26</font></a> But an angel of the Lord spoke to
Philip, saying, &quot;Arise, and go toward the south to the way that goes
down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desert.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:27</font></a> He arose and went; and
behold, there was a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under
Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had
come to Jerusalem to worship.  <a name="C8V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:28</font></a> He was returning and sitting in
his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.
<p> <a name="C8V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:29</font></a> The Spirit said to
Philip, &quot;Go near, and join yourself to this chariot.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:30</font></a> Philip ran to him, and
heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, &quot;Do you understand
what you are reading?&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:31</font></a> He said, &quot;How can
I, unless someone explains it to me?&quot; He begged Philip to come up and
sit with him.  <a name="C8V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:32</font></a> Now the
passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;He was led as a sheep to the slaughter.
<dd>As a lamb before his shearer is silent,
<dd>so he doesn't open his mouth.
<dt> <a name="C8V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:33</font></a> In his humiliation,
his judgment was taken away.
<dd>Who will declare His generation?
<dd>For his life is taken from the earth.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N29">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C8V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:34</font></a> The eunuch answered
Philip, &quot;Who is the prophet talking about? About himself, or about
someone else?&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:35</font></a> Philip opened his
mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached to him Jesus.  <a name="C8V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:36</font></a> As they went on the way, they
came to some water, and the eunuch said, &quot;Behold, here is water. What
is keeping me from being baptized?&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:37</font></a> <font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N30">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C8V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:38</font></a> He commanded the chariot to stand
still, and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch,
and he baptized him.
<p> <a name="C8V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:39</font></a> When they came up out
of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, and the eunuch
didn't see him any more, for he went on his way rejoicing.  <a name="C8V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:40</font></a> But Philip was found at Azotus.
Passing through, he preached the Good News to all the cities, until he
came to Caesarea.
<p> <a name="C9V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:1</font></a> But Saul, still
breathing threats and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to
the high priest,  <a name="C9V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:2</font></a> and asked
for letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus, that if he found any
who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to
Jerusalem.  <a name="C9V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:3</font></a> As he traveled,
it happened that he got close to Damascus, and suddenly a light from the
sky shone around him.  <a name="C9V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:4</font></a> He
fell on the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, &quot;Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:5</font></a> He said, &quot;Who are
you, Lord?&quot;
<p>The Lord said, &quot;I am Jesus, whom you are
persecuting.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N31">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C9V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:6</font></a> <a href="#N32">But</a> rise up,
and enter into the city, and you will be told what you must
do.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:7</font></a> The men who traveled
with him stood speechless, hearing the sound, but seeing no one.  <a name="C9V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:8</font></a> Saul arose from the ground, and
when his eyes were opened, he saw no one. They led him by the hand, and
brought him into Damascus.  <a name="C9V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:9</font></a> He was without sight for three
days, and neither ate nor drank.
<p> <a name="C9V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:10</font></a> Now there was a
certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a
vision, &quot;Ananias!&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;Behold, it's me, Lord.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:11</font></a> The Lord said to him,
&quot;Arise, and go to the street which is called
Straight, and inquire in the house of <a href="#N33">Judah</a> for one
named Saul, a man of Tarsus. For behold, he is praying,  <a name="C9V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:12</font></a> and in a vision he has seen a man
named Ananias coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he might
receive his sight.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:13</font></a> But Ananias answered,
&quot;Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he did to
your saints at Jerusalem.  <a name="C9V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:14</font></a> Here he has authority from the
chief priests to bind all who call on your name.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:15</font></a> But the Lord said to
him, &quot;Go your way, for he is my chosen vessel to bear
my name before the nations and kings, and the children of Israel.  <a name="C9V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:16</font></a> For I will show him how many
things he must suffer for my name's sake.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:17</font></a> Ananias departed, and
entered into the house. Laying his hands on him, he said, &quot;Brother
Saul, the Lord, who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has
sent me, that you may receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy
Spirit.&quot;  <a name="C9V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:18</font></a> Immediately
something like scales fell from his eyes, and he received his sight. He
arose and was baptized.  <a name="C9V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:19</font></a> He took food and was
strengthened. Saul stayed several days with the disciples who were at
Damascus.  <a name="C9V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:20</font></a> Immediately in
the synagogues he proclaimed the Christ, that he is the Son of God.
 <a name="C9V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:21</font></a> All who heard him were
amazed, and said, &quot;Isn't this he who in Jerusalem made havoc of those
who called on this name? And he had come here intending to bring them
bound before the chief priests!&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:22</font></a> But Saul increased
more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus, proving
that this is the Christ.  <a name="C9V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:23</font></a> When many days were fulfilled,
the Jews conspired together to kill him,  <a name="C9V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:24</font></a> but their plot became known to
Saul. They watched the gates both day and night that they might kill him,
 <a name="C9V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:25</font></a> but his disciples took
him by night, and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket.
 <a name="C9V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:26</font></a> When Saul had come to
Jerusalem, he tried to join himself to the disciples; but they were all
afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.  <a name="C9V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:27</font></a> But Barnabas took him, and
brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the Lord
in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how at Damascus he had
preached boldly in the name of Jesus.  <a name="C9V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:28</font></a> He was with them <a
href="#N34">entering into</a> Jerusalem,  <a name="C9V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:29</font></a> preaching boldly in the name of
the Lord. He spoke and disputed against the <a href="#N35">Hellenists,</a>
but they were seeking to kill him.  <a name="C9V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:30</font></a> When the <a
href="#N36">brothers</a> knew it, they brought him down to Caesarea, and
sent him off to Tarsus.  <a name="C9V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:31</font></a> So the assemblies throughout all
Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, and were built up. They were
multiplied, walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy
Spirit.
<p> <a name="C9V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:32</font></a> It happened, as Peter
went throughout all those parts, he came down also to the saints who lived
at Lydda.  <a name="C9V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:33</font></a> There he found
a certain man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years,
because he was paralyzed.  <a name="C9V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:34</font></a> Peter said to him, &quot;Aeneas,
Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and make your bed!&quot; Immediately he
arose.  <a name="C9V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:35</font></a> All who lived at
Lydda and in Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.
<p> <a name="C9V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:36</font></a> Now there was at Joppa
a certain disciple named Tabitha, which when translated, means <a
href="#N37">Dorcas.</a> This woman was full of good works and acts of
mercy which she did.  <a name="C9V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:37</font></a> It
happened in those days that she fell sick, and died. When they had washed
her, they laid her in an upper chamber.  <a name="C9V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:38</font></a> As Lydda was near Joppa, the
disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent <a href="#N38">two men</a>
to him, imploring him not to delay in coming to them.  <a name="C9V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:39</font></a> Peter got up and went with them.
When he had come, they brought him into the upper chamber. All the widows
stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had
made while she was with them.  <a name="C9V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:40</font></a> Peter put them all out, and
kneeled down and prayed. Turning to the body, he said, &quot;Tabitha, get
up!&quot; She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.  <a name="C9V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:41</font></a> He gave her his hand, and raised
her up. Calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.  <a name="C9V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:42</font></a> And it became known throughout
all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.  <a name="C9V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:43</font></a> It happened, that he stayed many
days in Joppa with one Simon, a tanner.
<p> <a name="C10V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:1</font></a> Now there was a
certain man in Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion of what was called
the Italian Regiment,  <a name="C10V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:2</font></a> a
devout man, and one who feared God with all his house, who gave gifts for
the needy generously to the people, and always prayed to God.  <a name="C10V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:3</font></a> At about <a href="#N39">the ninth
hour of the day</a>, he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God coming to
him, and saying to him, &quot;Cornelius!&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:4</font></a> He, fastening his eyes
on him, and being frightened, said, &quot;What is it, Lord?&quot;
<p>He said to him, &quot;Your prayers and your gifts to the needy have
gone up for a memorial before God.  <a name="C10V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:5</font></a> Now send men to Joppa, and get
Simon, who is surnamed Peter.  <a name="C10V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:6</font></a> He lodges with one Simon, a
tanner, whose house is by the seaside.<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N40">*</a></sup></font>&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:7</font></a> When the angel who
spoke to him had departed, Cornelius called two of his household servants
and a devout soldier of those who waited on him continually.  <a name="C10V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:8</font></a> Having explained everything to
them, he sent them to Joppa.  <a name="C10V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:9</font></a> Now on the next day as they were
on their journey, and got close to the city, Peter went up on the housetop
to pray at about noon.  <a name="C10V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:10</font></a> He became hungry and desired to
eat, but while they were preparing, he fell into a trance.  <a name="C10V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:11</font></a> He saw heaven opened and a
certain container descending to him, like a great sheet let down by four
corners on the earth,  <a name="C10V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:12</font></a> in
which were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals,
reptiles, and birds of the sky.  <a name="C10V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:13</font></a> A voice came to him, &quot;Rise, Peter, kill and eat!&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:14</font></a> But Peter said,
&quot;Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or
unclean.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:15</font></a> A voice came to him
again the second time, &quot;What God has cleansed, you
must not call unclean.&quot;  <a name="C10V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:16</font></a> This was done three times, and
immediately the vessel was received up into heaven.  <a name="C10V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:17</font></a> Now while Peter was very
perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold,
the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house,
stood before the gate,  <a name="C10V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:18</font></a> and called and asked whether
Simon, who was surnamed Peter, was lodging there.  <a name="C10V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:19</font></a> While Peter was pondering the
vision, the Spirit said to him, &quot;Behold, <a href="#N41">three</a> men
seek you.  <a name="C10V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:20</font></a> But arise, get
down, and go with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:21</font></a> Peter went down to
the men, and said, &quot;Behold, I am he whom you seek. Why have you
come?&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:22</font></a> They said,
&quot;Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man and one who fears God, and
well spoken of by all the nation of the Jews, was directed by a holy angel
to invite you to his house, and to listen to what you say.&quot;  <a name="C10V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:23</font></a> So he called them in and lodged
them. On the next day Peter arose and went out with them, and some of the
brothers from Joppa accompanied him.  <a name="C10V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:24</font></a> On the next day they entered
into Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his
relatives and his near friends.  <a name="C10V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:25</font></a> When it happened that Peter
entered, Cornelius met him, fell down at his feet, and worshiped him.
 <a name="C10V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:26</font></a> But Peter raised him up,
saying, &quot;Stand up! I myself am also a man.&quot;  <a name="C10V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:27</font></a> As he talked with him, he went
in and found many gathered together.  <a name="C10V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:28</font></a> He said to them, &quot;You
yourselves know how it is an unlawful thing for a man who is a Jew to join
himself or come to one of another nation, but God has shown me that I
shouldn't call any man unholy or unclean.  <a name="C10V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:29</font></a> Therefore also I came without
complaint when I was sent for. I ask therefore, why did you send for
me?&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:30</font></a> Cornelius said,
&quot;Four days ago, I was fasting until this hour, and at <a
href="#N42">the ninth hour,</a> I prayed in my house, and behold, a man
stood before me in bright clothing,  <a name="C10V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:31</font></a> and said, 'Cornelius, your
prayer is heard, and your gifts to the needy are remembered in the sight
of God.  <a name="C10V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:32</font></a> Send therefore
to Joppa, and summon Simon, who is surnamed Peter. He lodges in the house
of Simon a tanner, by the seaside. When he comes, he will speak to you.'
 <a name="C10V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:33</font></a> Therefore I sent to you
at once, and it was good of you to come. Now therefore we are all here
present in the sight of God to hear all things that have been commanded
you by God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:34</font></a> Peter opened his
mouth and said, &quot;Truly I perceive that God doesn't show favoritism;
 <a name="C10V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:35</font></a> but in every nation he
who fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.  <a name="C10V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:36</font></a> The word which he sent to the
children of Israel, preaching good news of peace by Jesus Christ--he is
Lord of all-- <a name="C10V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:37</font></a> that spoken
word you yourselves know, which was proclaimed throughout all Judea,
beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;  <a name="C10V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:38</font></a> even Jesus of Nazareth, how God
anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing
good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with
him.  <a name="C10V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:39</font></a> We are witnesses of
everything he did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom
they <a href="#N43">also</a> killed, hanging him on a tree.  <a name="C10V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:40</font></a> God raised him up the third day,
and gave him to be revealed,  <a name="C10V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:41</font></a> not to all the people, but to
witnesses who were chosen before by God, to us, who ate and drank with him
after he rose from the dead.  <a name="C10V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:42</font></a> He commanded us to preach to the
people and to testify that this is he who is appointed by God as the Judge
of the living and the dead.  <a name="C10V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:43</font></a> All the prophets testify about
him, that through his name everyone who believes in him will receive
remission of sins.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:44</font></a> While Peter was still
speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the
word.  <a name="C10V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:45</font></a> They of the
circumcision who believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because
the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the Gentiles.  <a name="C10V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:46</font></a> For they heard them speaking in
other languages and magnifying God.
<p>Then Peter answered,  <a name="C10V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:47</font></a> &quot;Can any man forbid the
water, that these who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we should
not be baptized?&quot;  <a name="C10V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:48</font></a> He commanded them to be baptized
in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay some days.
<p> <a name="C11V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:1</font></a> Now the apostles and
the <a href="#N44">brothers</a> who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles
had also received the word of God.  <a name="C11V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:2</font></a> When Peter had come up to
Jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision contended with him,  <a name="C11V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:3</font></a> saying, &quot;You went in to
uncircumcised men, and ate with them!&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:4</font></a> But Peter began, and
explained to them in order, saying,  <a name="C11V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:5</font></a> &quot;I was in the city of Joppa
praying, and in a trance I saw a vision: a certain container descending,
like it was a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners. It came as
far as me.  <a name="C11V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:6</font></a> When I had
looked intently at it, I considered, and saw the four-footed animals of
the earth, wild animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky.  <a name="C11V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:7</font></a> I also heard a voice saying to
me, 'Rise, Peter, kill and eat!'  <a name="C11V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:8</font></a> But I said, 'Not so, Lord, for
nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered into my mouth.'  <a name="C11V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:9</font></a> But a voice answered me the
second time out of heaven, 'What God has cleansed, don't
you call unclean.'  <a name="C11V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:10</font></a> This was done three times, and
all were drawn up again into heaven.  <a name="C11V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:11</font></a> Behold, immediately three men
stood before the house where I was, having been sent from Caesarea to me.
 <a name="C11V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:12</font></a> The Spirit told me to go
with them, without discriminating. These six brothers also accompanied me,
and we entered into the man's house.  <a name="C11V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:13</font></a> He told us how he had seen the
angel standing in his house, and saying to him, 'Send to Joppa, and get
Simon, whose surname is Peter,  <a name="C11V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:14</font></a> who will speak to you words by
which you will be saved, you and all your house.'  <a name="C11V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:15</font></a> As I began to speak, the Holy
Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning.  <a name="C11V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:16</font></a> I remembered the word of the
Lord, how he said, 'John indeed baptized in water, but you
will be baptized in the Holy Spirit.'  <a name="C11V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:17</font></a> If then God gave to them the
same gift as us, when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I,
that I could withstand God?&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:18</font></a> When they heard these
things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, &quot;Then God
has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life!&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:19</font></a> They therefore who
were scattered abroad by the oppression that arose about Stephen traveled
as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one
except to Jews only.  <a name="C11V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:20</font></a> But
there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come
to Antioch, spoke to the <a href="#N45">Hellenists,</a> preaching the Lord
Jesus.  <a name="C11V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:21</font></a> The hand of the
Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.
 <a name="C11V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:22</font></a> The report concerning
them came to the ears of the assembly which was in Jerusalem. They sent
out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch,  <a name="C11V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:23</font></a> who, when he had come, and had
seen the grace of God, was glad. He exhorted them all, that with purpose
of heart they should remain near to the Lord.  <a name="C11V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:24</font></a> For he was a good man, and full
of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and many people were added to the Lord.
<p> <a name="C11V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:25</font></a> Barnabas went out to
Tarsus to look for Saul.  <a name="C11V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:26</font></a> When he had found him, he
brought him to Antioch. It happened, that for a whole year they were
gathered together with the assembly, and taught many people. The disciples
were first called Christians in Antioch.
<p> <a name="C11V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:27</font></a> Now in these days,
prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.  <a name="C11V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:28</font></a> One of them named Agabus stood
up, and indicated by the Spirit that there should be a great famine all
over the world, which also happened in the days of Claudius.  <a name="C11V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:29</font></a> As any of the disciples had
plenty, each determined to send relief to the brothers who lived in Judea;
 <a name="C11V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:30</font></a> which they also did,
sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
<p> <a name="C12V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:1</font></a> Now about that time,
Herod the king stretched out his hands to oppress some of the assembly.
 <a name="C12V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:2</font></a> He killed James, the
brother of John, with the sword.  <a name="C12V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:3</font></a> When he saw that it pleased the
Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. This was during the days of
unleavened bread.  <a name="C12V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:4</font></a> When he
had arrested him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads
of four soldiers each to guard him, intending to bring him out to the
people after the Passover.  <a name="C12V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:5</font></a> Peter therefore was kept in the
prison, but constant prayer was made by the assembly to God for him.
 <a name="C12V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:6</font></a> The same night when Herod
was about to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound
with two chains. Guards in front of the door kept the prison.
<p> <a name="C12V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:7</font></a> And behold, an angel
of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter
on the side, and woke him up, saying, &quot;Stand up quickly!&quot; His
chains fell off from his hands.  <a name="C12V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:8</font></a> The angel said to him, &quot;Get
dressed and put on your sandals.&quot; He did so. He said to him,
&quot;Put on your cloak, and follow me.&quot;  <a name="C12V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:9</font></a> And he went out and followed him.
He didn't know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought
he saw a vision.  <a name="C12V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:10</font></a> When
they were past the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate
that leads into the city, which opened to them by itself. They went out,
and went down one street, and immediately the angel departed from him.
<p> <a name="C12V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:11</font></a> When Peter had come
to himself, he said, &quot;Now I truly know that the Lord has sent out his
angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from everything the
Jewish people were expecting.&quot;  <a name="C12V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:12</font></a> Thinking about that, he came to
the house of Mary, the mother of John whose surname was Mark, where many
were gathered together and were praying.  <a name="C12V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:13</font></a> When Peter knocked at the door
of the gate, a maid named Rhoda came to answer.  <a name="C12V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:14</font></a> When she recognized Peter's
voice, she didn't open the gate for joy, but ran in, and reported that
Peter was standing in front of the gate.
<p> <a name="C12V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:15</font></a> They said to her,
&quot;You are crazy!&quot; But she insisted that it was so. They said,
&quot;It is his angel.&quot;  <a name="C12V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:16</font></a> But Peter continued knocking.
When they had opened, they saw him, and were amazed.  <a name="C12V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:17</font></a> But he, beckoning to them with
his hand to be silent, declared to them how the Lord had brought him out
of the prison. He said, &quot;Tell these things to James, and to the
brothers.&quot; Then he departed, and went to another place.
<p> <a name="C12V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:18</font></a> Now as soon as it was
day, there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of
Peter.  <a name="C12V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:19</font></a> When Herod had
sought for him, and didn't find him, he examined the guards, and commanded
that they should be put to death. He went down from Judea to Caesarea, and
stayed there.  <a name="C12V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:20</font></a> Now Herod
was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. They came with one
accord to him, and, having made Blastus, the king's personal aide, their
friend, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king's
country for food.  <a name="C12V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:21</font></a> On an
appointed day, Herod dressed himself in royal clothing, sat on the throne,
and gave a speech to them.  <a name="C12V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:22</font></a> The people shouted, &quot;The
voice of a god, and not of a man!&quot;  <a name="C12V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:23</font></a> Immediately an angel of the Lord
struck him, because he didn't give God the glory, and he was eaten by
worms and died.
<p> <a name="C12V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:24</font></a> But the word of God
grew and multiplied.  <a name="C12V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:25</font></a> Barnabas and Saul returned <a
href="#N46">to</a> Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their service, also
taking with them John whose surname was Mark.
<p> <a name="C13V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:1</font></a> Now in the assembly
that was at Antioch there were some prophets and teachers: Barnabas,
Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen the foster brother
of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.  <a name="C13V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:2</font></a> As they served the Lord and
fasted, the Holy Spirit said, &quot;Separate Barnabas and Saul for me, for
the work to which I have called them.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:3</font></a> Then, when they had
fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
 <a name="C13V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:4</font></a> So, being sent out by the
Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia. From there they sailed to Cyprus.
 <a name="C13V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:5</font></a> When they were at
Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. They
had also John as their attendant.  <a name="C13V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:6</font></a> When they had gone through the
island to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew,
whose name was Bar Jesus,  <a name="C13V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:7</font></a> who was with the proconsul,
Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. This man summoned Barnabas and
Saul, and sought to hear the word of God.  <a name="C13V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:8</font></a> But Elymas the sorcerer (for so
is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the
proconsul from the faith.  <a name="C13V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:9</font></a> But Saul, who is also called
Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him,  <a name="C13V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:10</font></a> and said, &quot;Full of all
deceit and all cunning, you son of the devil, you enemy of all
righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?
 <a name="C13V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:11</font></a> Now, behold, the hand of
the Lord is on you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a
season!&quot;
<p>Immediately a mist and darkness fell on him. He went around seeking
someone to lead him by the hand.  <a name="C13V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:12</font></a> Then the proconsul, when he saw
what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.
<p> <a name="C13V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:13</font></a> Now Paul and his
company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia. John
departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.  <a name="C13V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:14</font></a> But they, passing on from Perga,
came to Antioch of Pisidia. They went into the synagogue on the Sabbath
day, and sat down.  <a name="C13V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:15</font></a> After
the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent
to them, saying, &quot;Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for
the people, speak.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:16</font></a> Paul stood up, and
beckoning with his hand said, &quot;Men of Israel, and you who fear God,
listen.  <a name="C13V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:17</font></a> The God of this
people<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N47">*</a></sup></font>
chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they stayed as aliens in
the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm, he led them out of it.
 <a name="C13V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:18</font></a> For a period of about
forty years he put up with them in the wilderness.  <a name="C13V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:19</font></a> When he had destroyed seven
nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land for an inheritance,
for about four hundred fifty years.  <a name="C13V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:20</font></a> After these things he gave them
judges until Samuel the prophet.  <a name="C13V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:21</font></a> Afterward they asked for a king,
and God gave to them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin,
for forty years.  <a name="C13V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:22</font></a> When he
had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, to whom he also
testified, 'I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who
will do all my will.'  <a name="C13V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:23</font></a> From this man's seed, God has
brought <a href="#N48">salvation</a> to Israel according to his promise,
 <a name="C13V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:24</font></a> before his coming, when
John had first preached the baptism of repentance <a href="#N49">to
Israel.</a>  <a name="C13V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:25</font></a> As John was
fulfilling his course, he said, 'What do you suppose that I am? I am not
he. But behold, one comes after me the sandals of whose feet I am not
worthy to untie.'  <a name="C13V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:26</font></a> Brothers, children of the stock
of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, the word of this salvation
is sent out to you.  <a name="C13V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:27</font></a> For
those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they didn't know
him, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath,
fulfilled them by condemning him.  <a name="C13V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:28</font></a> Though they found no cause for
death, they still asked Pilate to have him killed.  <a name="C13V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:29</font></a> When they had fulfilled all
things that were written about him, they took him down from the tree, and
laid him in a tomb.  <a name="C13V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:30</font></a> But
God raised him from the dead,  <a name="C13V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:31</font></a> and he was seen for many days by
those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his
witnesses to the people.  <a name="C13V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:32</font></a> We bring you good news of the
promise made to the fathers,  <a name="C13V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:33</font></a> that God has fulfilled the same
to us, their children, in that he raised up Jesus. As it is also written
in the second psalm,
<dl>
<dt>'You are my Son.
<dd>Today I have become your father.'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N50">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C13V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:34</font></a> &quot;Concerning that
he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he
has spoken thus: 'I will give you the holy and sure blessings of
David.'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N51">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C13V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:35</font></a> Therefore he says also in
another psalm, 'You will not allow your Holy One to see decay.'<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N52">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C13V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:36</font></a> For David, after he had in his
own generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was laid with
his fathers, and saw decay.  <a name="C13V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:37</font></a> But he whom God raised up saw no
decay.  <a name="C13V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:38</font></a> Be it known to
you therefore, <a href="#N53">brothers</a>, that through this man is
proclaimed to you remission of sins,  <a name="C13V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:39</font></a> and by him everyone who believes
is justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the
law of Moses.  <a name="C13V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:40</font></a> Beware
therefore, lest that come on you which is spoken in the prophets:
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C13V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:41</font></a> 'Behold, you
scoffers, and wonder, and perish;
<dd>for I work a work in your days,
<dd>a work which you will in no way believe, if one declares it to
you.'&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N54">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C13V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:42</font></a> So when the Jews went
out of the synagogue, the Gentiles begged that these words might be
preached to them the next Sabbath.  <a name="C13V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:43</font></a> Now when the synagogue broke up,
many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas;
who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.  <a name="C13V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:44</font></a> The next Sabbath almost the
whole city was gathered together to hear the word of God.  <a name="C13V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:45</font></a> But when the Jews saw the
multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things
which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed.
<p> <a name="C13V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:46</font></a> Paul and Barnabas
spoke out boldly, and said, &quot;It was necessary that God's word should
be spoken to you first. Since indeed you thrust it from you, and judge
yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.
 <a name="C13V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:47</font></a> For so has the Lord
commanded us, saying,
<dl>
<dt>'I have set you as a light for the Gentiles,

<p> <a name="C13V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:48</font></a> As the Gentiles heard
this, they were glad, and glorified the word of God. As many as were
appointed to eternal life believed.  <a name="C13V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:49</font></a> The Lord's word was spread
abroad throughout all the region.  <a name="C13V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:50</font></a> But the Jews stirred up the
devout and prominent women and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a
persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and threw them out of their
borders.  <a name="C13V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:51</font></a> But they shook
off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium.  <a name="C13V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:52</font></a> The disciples were filled with
joy with the Holy Spirit.
<p> <a name="C14V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:1</font></a> It happened in Iconium
that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke
that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed.  <a name="C14V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:2</font></a> But the <a
href="#N56">disbelieving</a> Jews stirred up and embittered the souls of
the Gentiles against the brothers.  <a name="C14V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:3</font></a> Therefore they stayed there a
long time, speaking boldly in the Lord, who testified to the word of his
grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.  <a name="C14V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:4</font></a> But the multitude of the city was
divided. Part sided with the Jews, and part with the apostles.  <a name="C14V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:5</font></a> When some of both the Gentiles
and the Jews, with their rulers, made a violent attempt to mistreat and
stone them,  <a name="C14V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:6</font></a> they became
aware of it, and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, Derbe, and the
surrounding region.  <a name="C14V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:7</font></a> There
they preached the Good News.
<p> <a name="C14V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:8</font></a> At Lystra a certain
man sat, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother's womb, who never
had walked.  <a name="C14V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:9</font></a> He was
listening to Paul speaking, who, fastening eyes on him, and seeing that he
had faith to be made whole,  <a name="C14V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:10</font></a> said with a loud voice,
&quot;Stand upright on your feet!&quot; He leaped up and walked.  <a name="C14V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:11</font></a> When the multitude saw what Paul
had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the language of Lycaonia,
&quot;The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!&quot;  <a name="C14V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:12</font></a> They called Barnabas
&quot;Jupiter,&quot; and Paul &quot;Mercury,&quot; because he was the
chief speaker.  <a name="C14V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:13</font></a> The
priest of Jupiter, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen
and garlands to the gates, and would have made a sacrifice along with the
multitudes.  <a name="C14V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:14</font></a> But when the
apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore their clothes, and
sprang into the multitude, crying out,  <a name="C14V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:15</font></a> &quot;Men, why are you doing
these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you
good news, that you should turn from these vain things to the living God,
who made the sky and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them;
 <a name="C14V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:16</font></a> who in the generations
gone by allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways.  <a name="C14V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:17</font></a> Yet he didn't leave himself
without witness, in that he did good and gave <a href="#N57">you</a> rains
from the sky and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and
gladness.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:18</font></a> Even saying these
things, they hardly stopped the multitudes from making a sacrifice to
them.  <a name="C14V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:19</font></a> But some Jews from
Antioch and Iconium came there, and having persuaded the multitudes, they
stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
<p> <a name="C14V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:20</font></a> But as the disciples
stood around him, he rose up, and entered into the city. On the next day
he went out with Barnabas to Derbe.  <a name="C14V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:21</font></a> When they had preached the Good
News to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra,
Iconium, and Antioch,  <a name="C14V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:22</font></a> confirming the souls of the
disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many
afflictions we must enter into the Kingdom of God.  <a name="C14V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:23</font></a> When they had appointed elders
for them in every assembly, and had prayed with fasting, they commended
them to the Lord, on whom they had believed.
<p> <a name="C14V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:24</font></a> They passed through
Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia.  <a name="C14V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:25</font></a> When they had spoken the word in
Perga, they went down to Attalia.  <a name="C14V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:26</font></a> From there they sailed to
Antioch, from where they had been committed to the grace of God for the
work which they had fulfilled.  <a name="C14V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:27</font></a> When they had arrived, and had
gathered the assembly together, they reported all the things that God had
done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the nations.
 <a name="C14V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:28</font></a> They stayed there with
the disciples for a long time.
<p> <a name="C15V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:1</font></a> Some men came down
from Judea and taught the brothers, &quot;Unless you are circumcised after
the custom of Moses, you can't be saved.&quot;  <a name="C15V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:2</font></a> Therefore when Paul and Barnabas
had no small discord and discussion with them, they appointed Paul and
Barnabas, and some others of them, to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles
and elders about this question.  <a name="C15V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:3</font></a> They, being sent on their way by
the assembly, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the
conversion of the Gentiles. They caused great joy to all the <a
href="#N58">brothers.</a>  <a name="C15V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:4</font></a> When they had come to Jerusalem,
they were received by the assembly and the apostles and the elders, and
they reported all things that God had done with them.
<p> <a name="C15V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:5</font></a> But some of the sect
of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, &quot;It is necessary to
circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:6</font></a> The apostles and the
elders were gathered together to see about this matter.  <a name="C15V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:7</font></a> When there had been much
discussion, Peter rose up and said to them, &quot;Brothers, you know that
a good while ago God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the nations
should hear the word of the Good News, and believe.  <a name="C15V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:8</font></a> God, who knows the heart,
testified about them, giving them the Holy Spirit, just like he did to us.
 <a name="C15V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:9</font></a> He made no distinction
between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.  <a name="C15V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:10</font></a> Now therefore why do you tempt
God, that you should put a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither
our fathers nor we were able to bear?  <a name="C15V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:11</font></a> But we believe that we are saved
through the grace of the Lord Jesus,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N59">*</a></sup></font> just as they are.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:12</font></a> All the multitude
kept silence, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul reporting what signs
and wonders God had done among the nations through them.  <a name="C15V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:13</font></a> After they were silent, James
answered, &quot;Brothers, listen to me.  <a name="C15V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:14</font></a> Simeon has reported how God
first visited the nations, to take out of them a people for his name.
 <a name="C15V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:15</font></a> This agrees with the
words of the prophets. As it is written,
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C15V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:16</font></a> 'After these things
I will return.
<dd>I will again build the tent of David, which has fallen.
<dd>I will again build its ruins.
<dt>I will set it up,
<dd> <a name="C15V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:17</font></a> That the rest of men
may seek after the Lord;
<dd>All the Gentiles who are called by my name,
<dt>Says the Lord, who does all these things.<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N60">*</a></sup></font>
<dd> <a name="C15V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:18</font></a> All his works are
known to God from eternity.'
</dl>
<p> <a name="C15V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:19</font></a> &quot;Therefore my
judgment is that we don't trouble those from among the Gentiles who turn
to God,  <a name="C15V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:20</font></a> but that we
write to them that they abstain from the pollution of idols, from sexual
immorality, from what is strangled, and from blood.  <a name="C15V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:21</font></a> For Moses from generations of
old has in every city those who preach him, being read in the synagogues
every Sabbath.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:22</font></a> Then it seemed good
to the apostles and the elders, with the whole assembly, to choose men out
of their company, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas: Judas
called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the <a
href="#N61">brothers.</a>  <a name="C15V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:23</font></a> They wrote these things by their
hand:
<p>&quot;The apostles, the elders, and the brothers, to the brothers who
are of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: greetings.  <a name="C15V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:24</font></a> Because we have heard that some
who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls,
saying, 'You must be circumcised and keep the law,' to whom we gave no
commandment;  <a name="C15V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:25</font></a> it seemed
good to us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them to
you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,  <a name="C15V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:26</font></a> men who have risked their lives
for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  <a name="C15V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:27</font></a> We have sent therefore Judas and
Silas, who themselves will also tell you the same things by word of mouth.
 <a name="C15V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:28</font></a> For it seemed good to
the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay no greater burden on you than these
necessary things:  <a name="C15V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:29</font></a> that
you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from things
strangled, and from sexual immorality, from which if you keep yourselves,
it will be well with you. Farewell.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:30</font></a> So, when they were
sent off, they came to Antioch. Having gathered the multitude together,
they delivered the letter.  <a name="C15V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:31</font></a> When they had read it, they
rejoiced over the encouragement.  <a name="C15V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:32</font></a> Judas and Silas, also being
prophets themselves, encouraged the brothers with many words, and
strengthened them.  <a name="C15V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:33</font></a> After
they had spent some time there, they were sent back with greetings from
the brothers to the apostles.  <a name="C15V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:34</font></a> <font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N62">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C15V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:35</font></a> But Paul and Barnabas stayed in
Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others
also.
<p> <a name="C15V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:36</font></a> After some days Paul
said to Barnabas, &quot;Let's return now and visit our brothers in every
city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, to see how they are
doing.&quot;  <a name="C15V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:37</font></a> Barnabas
planned to take John, who was called Mark, with them also.  <a name="C15V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:38</font></a> But Paul didn't think that it
was a good idea to take with them someone who had withdrawn from them in
Pamphylia, and didn't go with them to do the work.  <a name="C15V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:39</font></a> Then the contention grew so
sharp that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark with him,
and sailed away to Cyprus,  <a name="C15V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:40</font></a> but Paul chose Silas, and went
out, being commended by the brothers to the grace of God.  <a name="C15V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:41</font></a> He went through Syria and
Cilicia, strengthening the assemblies.
<p> <a name="C16V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:1</font></a> He came to Derbe and
Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son
of a Jewess who believed; but his father was a Greek.  <a name="C16V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:2</font></a> The brothers who were at Lystra
and Iconium gave a good testimony about him.  <a name="C16V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:3</font></a> Paul wanted to have him go out
with him, and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in
those parts; for they all knew that his father was a Greek.  <a name="C16V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:4</font></a> As they went on their way through
the cities, they delivered the decrees to them to keep which had been
ordained by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem.  <a name="C16V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:5</font></a> So the assemblies were
strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.
<p> <a name="C16V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:6</font></a> When they had gone
through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy
Spirit to speak the word in Asia.  <a name="C16V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:7</font></a> When they had come opposite
Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit didn't allow them.
 <a name="C16V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:8</font></a> Passing by Mysia, they
came down to Troas.  <a name="C16V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:9</font></a> A
vision appeared to Paul in the night. There was a man of Macedonia
standing, begging him, and saying, &quot;Come over into Macedonia and help
us.&quot;  <a name="C16V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:10</font></a> When he had
seen the vision, immediately we sought to go out to Macedonia, concluding
that the Lord had called us to preach the Good News to them.  <a name="C16V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:11</font></a> Setting sail therefore from
Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to
Neapolis;  <a name="C16V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:12</font></a> and from there
to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the foremost of the district, a
Roman colony. We were staying some days in this city.
<p> <a name="C16V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:13</font></a> On the Sabbath day we
went forth outside of the city by a riverside, where we supposed there was
a place of prayer, and we sat down, and spoke to the women who had come
together.  <a name="C16V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:14</font></a> A certain
woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one who
worshiped God, heard us; whose heart the Lord opened to listen to the
things which were spoken by Paul.  <a name="C16V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:15</font></a> When she and her household were
baptized, she begged us, saying, &quot;If you have judged me to be
faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and stay.&quot; So she persuaded
us.
<p> <a name="C16V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:16</font></a> It happened, as we
were going to prayer, that a certain girl having a spirit of divination
met us, who brought her masters much gain by fortune telling.  <a name="C16V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:17</font></a> Following Paul and us, she cried
out, &quot;These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us
the way of salvation!&quot;  <a name="C16V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:18</font></a> She was doing this for many days.
<p>But Paul, becoming greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit,
&quot;I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!&quot;
It came out that very hour.  <a name="C16V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:19</font></a> But when her masters saw that
the hope of their gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas, and dragged
them into the marketplace before the rulers.  <a name="C16V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:20</font></a> When they had brought them to
the magistrates, they said, &quot;These men, being Jews, are agitating our
city,  <a name="C16V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:21</font></a> and set forth
customs which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe, being
Romans.&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:22</font></a> The multitude rose up
together against them, and the magistrates tore their clothes off of them,
and commanded them to be beaten with rods.  <a name="C16V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:23</font></a> When they had laid many stripes
on them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them
safely,  <a name="C16V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:24</font></a> who, having
received such a command, threw them into the inner prison, and secured
their feet in the stocks.
<p> <a name="C16V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:25</font></a> But about midnight
Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners
were listening to them.  <a name="C16V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:26</font></a> Suddenly there was a great
earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and
immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's bonds were loosened.
 <a name="C16V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:27</font></a> The jailer, being roused
out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was
about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.  <a name="C16V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:28</font></a> But Paul cried with a loud
voice, saying, &quot;Don't harm yourself, for we are all here!&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:29</font></a> He called for lights
and sprang in, and, fell down trembling before Paul and Silas,  <a name="C16V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:30</font></a> and brought them out and said,
&quot;Sirs, what must I do to be saved?&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:31</font></a> They said,
&quot;Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and
your household.&quot;  <a name="C16V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:32</font></a> They spoke the word of the Lord
to him, and to all who were in his house.
<p> <a name="C16V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:33</font></a> He took them the same
hour of the night, and washed their stripes, and was immediately baptized,
he and all his household.  <a name="C16V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:34</font></a> He brought them up into his
house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his
household, having believed in God.
<p> <a name="C16V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:35</font></a> But when it was day,
the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, &quot;Let those men go.&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:36</font></a> The jailer reported
these words to Paul, saying, &quot;The magistrates have sent to let you
go; now therefore come out, and go in peace.&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:37</font></a> But Paul said to
them, &quot;They have beaten us publicly, without a trial, men who are
Romans, and have cast us into prison! Do they now release us secretly? No,
most certainly, but let them come themselves and bring us out!&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:38</font></a> The sergeants
reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they
heard that they were Romans,  <a name="C16V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:39</font></a> and they came and begged them.
When they had brought them out, they asked them to depart from the city.
 <a name="C16V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:40</font></a> They went out of the
prison, and entered into Lydia's house. When they had seen the brothers,
they encouraged them, and departed.
<p> <a name="C17V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:1</font></a> Now when they had
passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where
there was a Jewish synagogue.  <a name="C17V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:2</font></a> Paul, as was his custom, went in
to them, and for three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the
Scriptures,  <a name="C17V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:3</font></a> explaining
and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the
dead, and saying, &quot;This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the
Christ.&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:4</font></a> Some of them were
persuaded, and joined Paul and Silas, of the devout Greeks a great
multitude, and not a few of the chief women.  <a name="C17V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:5</font></a> <a href="#N63">But the
unpersuaded Jews took along</a> some wicked men from the marketplace, and
gathering a crowd, set the city in an uproar. Assaulting the house of
Jason, they sought to bring them out to the people.  <a name="C17V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:6</font></a> When they didn't find them, they
dragged Jason and certain <a href="#N64">brothers</a> before the rulers of
the city, crying, &quot;These who have turned the world upside down have
come here also,  <a name="C17V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:7</font></a> whom
Jason has received. These all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar,
saying that there is another king, Jesus!&quot;  <a name="C17V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:8</font></a> The multitude and the rulers of
the city were troubled when they heard these things.  <a name="C17V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:9</font></a> When they had taken security from
Jason and the rest, they let them go.  <a name="C17V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:10</font></a> The brothers immediately sent
Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea. When they arrived, they went into
the Jewish synagogue.
<p> <a name="C17V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:11</font></a> Now these were more
noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all
readiness of the mind, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these
things were so.  <a name="C17V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:12</font></a> Many of
them therefore believed; also of the prominent Greek women, and not a few
men.  <a name="C17V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:13</font></a> But when the Jews
of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul
at Beroea also, they came there likewise, agitating the multitudes.
 <a name="C17V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:14</font></a> Then the brothers
immediately sent out Paul to go as far as to the sea, and Silas and
Timothy still stayed there.  <a name="C17V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:15</font></a> But those who escorted Paul
brought him as far as Athens. Receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy
that they should come to him very quickly, they departed.
<p> <a name="C17V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:16</font></a> Now while Paul waited
for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city
full of idols.  <a name="C17V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:17</font></a> So he
reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the
marketplace every day with those who met him.  <a name="C17V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:18</font></a> Some of the Epicurean and Stoic
philosophers <a href="#N65">also</a> were conversing with him. Some said,
&quot;What does this babbler want to say?&quot;
<p>Others said, &quot;He seems to be advocating foreign deities,&quot;
because he preached Jesus and the resurrection.
<p> <a name="C17V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:19</font></a> They took hold of
him, and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, &quot;May we know what this
new teaching is, which is spoken by you?  <a name="C17V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:20</font></a> For you bring certain strange
things to our ears. We want to know therefore what these things
mean.&quot;  <a name="C17V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:21</font></a> Now all the
Athenians and the strangers living there spent their time in nothing else,
but either to tell or to hear some new thing.
<p> <a name="C17V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:22</font></a> Paul stood in the
middle of the Areopagus, and said, &quot;You men of Athens, I perceive
that you are very religious in all things.  <a name="C17V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:23</font></a> For as I passed along, and
observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this
inscription: 'TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.' What therefore you worship in ignorance,
this I announce to you.  <a name="C17V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:24</font></a> The God who made the world and
all things in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, doesn't dwell in
temples made with hands,  <a name="C17V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:25</font></a> neither is he served by men's
hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself gives to all life
and breath, and all things.  <a name="C17V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:26</font></a> He made from one blood every
nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth, having determined
appointed seasons, and the boundaries of their dwellings,  <a name="C17V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:27</font></a> that they should seek the Lord,
if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him, though he is not far
from each one of us.  <a name="C17V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:28</font></a> 'For in him we live, and move,
and have our being.' As some of your own poets have said, 'For we are also
his offspring.'  <a name="C17V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:29</font></a> Being
then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is
like gold, or silver, or stone, engraved by art and design of man.  <a name="C17V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:30</font></a> The times of ignorance therefore
God overlooked. But now he commands that all people everywhere should
repent,  <a name="C17V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:31</font></a> because he has
appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the
man whom he has ordained; of which he has given assurance to all men, in
that he has raised him from the dead.&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:32</font></a> Now when they heard
of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, &quot;We
want to hear you again concerning this.&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:33</font></a> Thus Paul went out
from among them.  <a name="C17V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:34</font></a> But
certain men joined with him, and believed, among whom also was Dionysius
the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
<p> <a name="C18V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:1</font></a> After these things
Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth.  <a name="C18V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:2</font></a> He found a certain Jew named
Aquila, a man of Pontus by race, who had recently come from Italy, with
his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart
from Rome. He came to them,  <a name="C18V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:3</font></a> and because he practiced the same
trade, he lived with them and worked, for by trade they were tent makers.
 <a name="C18V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:4</font></a> He reasoned in the
synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.  <a name="C18V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:5</font></a> But when Silas and Timothy came
down from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit, testifying to the
Jews that Jesus was the Christ.  <a name="C18V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:6</font></a> When they opposed him and
blasphemed, he shook out his clothing and said to them, &quot;Your blood
be on your own heads! I am clean. From now on, I will go to the
Gentiles!&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:7</font></a> He departed there, and
went into the house of a certain man named Justus, one who worshiped God,
whose house was next door to the synagogue.  <a name="C18V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:8</font></a> Crispus, the ruler of the
synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house. Many of the
Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptized.  <a name="C18V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:9</font></a> The Lord said to Paul in the
night by a vision, &quot;Don't be afraid, but speak and
don't be silent;  <a name="C18V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:10</font></a> for I
am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many
people in this city.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:11</font></a> He lived there a year
and six months, teaching the word of God among them.  <a name="C18V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:12</font></a> But when Gallio was proconsul of
Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him
before the judgment seat,  <a name="C18V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:13</font></a> saying, &quot;This man persuades
men to worship God contrary to the law.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:14</font></a> But when Paul was
about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, &quot;If indeed it were
a matter of wrong or of wicked crime, you Jews, it would be reasonable
that I should bear with you;  <a name="C18V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:15</font></a> but if they are questions about
words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves. For I don't want
to be a judge of these matters.&quot;  <a name="C18V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:16</font></a> He drove them from the judgment
seat.
<p> <a name="C18V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:17</font></a> Then all the Greeks
laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before
the judgment seat. Gallio didn't care about any of these things.
<p> <a name="C18V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:18</font></a> Paul, having stayed
after this many more days, took his leave of the <a
href="#N66">brothers,</a> and sailed from there for Syria, together with
Priscilla and Aquila. He shaved his head in Cenchreae, for he had a vow.
 <a name="C18V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:19</font></a> He came to Ephesus, and
he left them there; but he himself entered into the synagogue, and
reasoned with the Jews.  <a name="C18V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:20</font></a> When they asked him to stay with
them a longer time, he declined;  <a name="C18V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:21</font></a> but taking his leave of them,
and saying, &quot;I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem,
but I will return again to you if God wills,&quot; he set sail from
Ephesus.
<p> <a name="C18V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:22</font></a> When he had landed at
Caesarea, he went up and greeted the assembly, and went down to Antioch.
 <a name="C18V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:23</font></a> Having spent some time
there, he departed, and went through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia,
in order, establishing all the disciples.  <a name="C18V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:24</font></a> Now a certain Jew named Apollos,
an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus. He was mighty in
the Scriptures.  <a name="C18V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:25</font></a> This man
had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit,
he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, although he
knew only the baptism of John.  <a name="C18V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:26</font></a> He began to speak boldly in the
synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside,
and explained to him the way of God more accurately.
<p> <a name="C18V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:27</font></a> When he had
determined to pass over into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him, and
wrote to the disciples to receive him. When he had come, he greatly helped
those who had believed through grace;  <a name="C18V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:28</font></a> for he powerfully refuted the
Jews, publicly showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
<p> <a name="C19V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:1</font></a> It happened that,
while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper
country, came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples.  <a name="C19V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:2</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Did you
receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?&quot;
<p>They said to him, &quot;No, we haven't even heard that there is a Holy
Spirit.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:3</font></a> He said, &quot;Into
what then were you baptized?&quot;
<p>They said, &quot;Into John's baptism.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:4</font></a> Paul said, &quot;John
indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that
they should believe in the one who would come after him, that is, in
Jesus.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:5</font></a> When they heard this,
they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.  <a name="C19V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:6</font></a> When Paul had laid his hands on
them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with other languages
and prophesied.  <a name="C19V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:7</font></a> They were
about twelve men in all.  <a name="C19V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:8</font></a> He entered into the synagogue,
and spoke boldly for a period of three months, reasoning and persuading
about the things concerning the Kingdom of God.
<p> <a name="C19V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:9</font></a> But when some were
hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude,
he departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the
school of Tyrannus.  <a name="C19V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:10</font></a> This
continued for two years, so that all those who lived in Asia heard the
word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
<p> <a name="C19V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:11</font></a> God worked special
miracles by the hands of Paul,  <a name="C19V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:12</font></a> so that even handkerchiefs or
aprons were carried away from his body to the sick, and the evil spirits
went out.  <a name="C19V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:13</font></a> But some of
the itinerant Jews, exorcists, took on themselves to invoke over those who
had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, &quot;We adjure
you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.&quot;  <a name="C19V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:14</font></a> There were seven sons of one
Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did this.
<p> <a name="C19V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:15</font></a> The evil spirit
answered, &quot;Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are you?&quot;
 <a name="C19V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:16</font></a> The man in whom the evil
spirit was leaped on them, and overpowered them, and prevailed against
them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.  <a name="C19V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:17</font></a> This became known to all, both
Jews and Greeks, who lived at Ephesus. Fear fell on them all, and the name
of the Lord Jesus was magnified.  <a name="C19V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:18</font></a> Many also of those who had
believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds.  <a name="C19V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:19</font></a> Many of those who practiced
magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of
all. They counted the price of them, and found it to be <a
href="#N67">fifty thousand pieces of silver.</a>  <a name="C19V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:20</font></a> So the word of the Lord was
growing and becoming mighty.
<p> <a name="C19V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:21</font></a> Now after these
things had ended, Paul determined in the spirit, when he had passed
through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, &quot;After I
have been there, I must also see Rome.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:22</font></a> Having sent into
Macedonia two of those who served him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself
stayed in Asia for a while.  <a name="C19V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:23</font></a> About that time there arose no
small stir concerning the Way.  <a name="C19V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:24</font></a> For a certain man named
Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no
little business to the craftsmen,  <a name="C19V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:25</font></a> whom he gathered together, with
the workmen of like occupation, and said, &quot;Sirs, you know that by
this business we have our wealth.  <a name="C19V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:26</font></a> You see and hear, that not at
Ephesus alone, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and
turned away many people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with
hands.  <a name="C19V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:27</font></a> Not only is there
danger that this our trade come into disrepute, but also that the temple
of the great goddess Artemis will be counted as nothing, and her majesty
destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worships.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:28</font></a> When they heard this
they were filled with anger, and cried out, saying, &quot;Great is Artemis
of the Ephesians!&quot;  <a name="C19V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:29</font></a> The whole city was filled with
confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, having seized
Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel.
 <a name="C19V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:30</font></a> When Paul wanted to
enter in to the people, the disciples didn't allow him.  <a name="C19V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:31</font></a> Certain also of the Asiarchs,
being his friends, sent to him and begged him not to venture into the
theater.  <a name="C19V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:32</font></a> Some therefore
cried one thing, and some another, for the assembly was in confusion. Most
of them didn't know why they had come together.  <a name="C19V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:33</font></a> They brought Alexander out of
the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. Alexander beckoned with his
hand, and would have made a defense to the people.  <a name="C19V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:34</font></a> But when they perceived that he
was a Jew, all with one voice for a time of about two hours cried out,
&quot;Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:35</font></a> When the town clerk
had quieted the multitude, he said, &quot;You men of Ephesus, what man is
there who doesn't know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of
the great goddess Artemis, and of the image which fell down from Zeus?
 <a name="C19V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:36</font></a> Seeing then that these
things can't be denied, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash.
 <a name="C19V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:37</font></a> For you have brought
these men here, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your
goddess.  <a name="C19V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:38</font></a> If therefore
Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a matter against anyone,
the courts are open, and there are proconsuls. Let them press charges
against one another.  <a name="C19V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:39</font></a> But
if you seek anything about other matters, it will be settled in the
regular assembly.  <a name="C19V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:40</font></a> For
indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this day's riot, there
being no cause. Concerning it, we wouldn't be able to give an account of
this commotion.&quot;  <a name="C19V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:41</font></a> When he had thus spoken, he
dismissed the assembly.
<p> <a name="C20V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:1</font></a> After the uproar had
ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, took leave of them, and departed to
go into Macedonia.  <a name="C20V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:2</font></a> When
he had gone through those parts, and had encouraged them with many words,
he came into Greece.  <a name="C20V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:3</font></a> When
he had spent three months there, and a plot was made against him by Jews
as he was about to set sail for Syria, he determined to return through
Macedonia.  <a name="C20V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:4</font></a> These
accompanied him as far as Asia: Sopater of Beroea; Aristarchus and
Secundus of the Thessalonians; Gaius of Derbe; Timothy; and Tychicus and
Trophimus of Asia.  <a name="C20V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:5</font></a> But
these had gone ahead, and were waiting for us at Troas.  <a name="C20V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:6</font></a> We sailed away from Philippi
after the days of Unleavened Bread, and came to them at Troas in five
days, where we stayed seven days.
<p> <a name="C20V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:7</font></a> On the first day of
the week, when the disciples were gathered together to break bread, Paul
talked with them, intending to depart on the next day, and continued his
speech until midnight.  <a name="C20V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:8</font></a> There were many lights in the
upper chamber where <a href="#N68">we</a> were gathered together.  <a name="C20V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:9</font></a> A certain young man named
Eutychus sat in the window, weighed down with deep sleep. As Paul spoke
still longer, being weighed down by his sleep, he fell down from the third
story, and was taken up dead.  <a name="C20V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:10</font></a> Paul went down, and fell upon
him, and embracing him said, &quot;Don't be troubled, for his life is in
him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:11</font></a> When he had gone up,
and had broken bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while,
even until break of day, he departed.  <a name="C20V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:12</font></a> They brought the boy in alive,
and were greatly comforted.
<p> <a name="C20V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:13</font></a> But we who went ahead
to the ship set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there, for
he had so arranged, intending himself to go by land.  <a name="C20V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:14</font></a> When he met us at Assos, we took
him aboard, and came to Mitylene.  <a name="C20V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:15</font></a> Sailing from there, we came the
following day opposite Chios. The next day we touched at Samos and stayed
at Trogyllium, and the day after we came to Miletus.  <a name="C20V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:16</font></a> For Paul had determined to sail
past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was
hastening, if it were possible for him, to be in Jerusalem on the day of
Pentecost.
<p> <a name="C20V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:17</font></a> From Miletus he sent
to Ephesus, and called to himself the elders of the assembly.  <a name="C20V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:18</font></a> When they had come to him, he
said to them, &quot;You yourselves know, from the first day that I set
foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time,  <a name="C20V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:19</font></a> serving the Lord with all
humility, with many tears, and with trials which happened to me by the
plots of the Jews;  <a name="C20V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:20</font></a> how I
didn't shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, teaching
you publicly and from house to house,  <a name="C20V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:21</font></a> testifying both to Jews and to
Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus.<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N69">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C20V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:22</font></a> Now, behold, I go bound by the
Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there;  <a name="C20V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:23</font></a> except that the Holy Spirit
testifies in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions wait for me.
 <a name="C20V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:24</font></a> But these things don't
count; nor do I hold my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my race
with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to fully
testify to the Good News of the grace of God.
<p> <a name="C20V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:25</font></a> &quot;Now, behold, I
know that you all, among whom I went about preaching the Kingdom of God,
will see my face no more.  <a name="C20V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:26</font></a> Therefore I testify to you this
day that I am clean from the blood of all men,  <a name="C20V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:27</font></a> for I didn't shrink from
declaring to you the whole counsel of God.  <a name="C20V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:28</font></a> Take heed, therefore, to
yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you
overseers, to shepherd the assembly of <a href="#N70">the Lord and</a> God
which he purchased with his own blood.  <a name="C20V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:29</font></a> For I know that after my
departure, vicious wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
 <a name="C20V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:30</font></a> Men will arise from
among your own selves, speaking perverse things, to draw away the
disciples after them.  <a name="C20V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:31</font></a> Therefore watch, remembering
that for a period of three years I didn't cease to admonish everyone night
and day with tears.  <a name="C20V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:32</font></a> Now,
<a href="#N71">brothers,</a> I entrust you to God, and to the word of his
grace, which is able to build up, and to give you the inheritance among
all those who are sanctified.  <a name="C20V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:33</font></a> I coveted no one's silver, or
gold, or clothing.  <a name="C20V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:34</font></a> You
yourselves know that these hands served my necessities, and those who were
with me.  <a name="C20V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:35</font></a> In all things I
gave you an example, that so laboring you ought to help the weak, and to
remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:36</font></a> When he had spoken
these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.  <a name="C20V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:37</font></a> They all wept a lot, and fell on
Paul's neck and kissed him,  <a name="C20V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:38</font></a> sorrowing most of all because of
the word which he had spoken, that they should see his face no more. And
they accompanied him to the ship.
<p> <a name="C21V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:1</font></a> When it happened that
we had parted from them and had set sail, we came with a straight course
to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.  <a name="C21V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:2</font></a> Having found a ship crossing over
to Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set sail.  <a name="C21V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:3</font></a> When we had come in sight of
Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed to Syria, and landed at
Tyre, for there the ship was to unload her cargo.  <a name="C21V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:4</font></a> Having found disciples, we stayed
there seven days. These said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should
not go up to Jerusalem.  <a name="C21V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:5</font></a> When it happened that we had
accomplished the days, we departed and went on our journey. They all, with
wives and children, brought us on our way until we were out of the city.
Kneeling down on the beach, we prayed.  <a name="C21V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:6</font></a> After saying goodbye to each
other, we went on board the ship, and they returned home again.
<p> <a name="C21V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:7</font></a> When we had finished
the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais. We greeted the brothers,
and stayed with them one day.  <a name="C21V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:8</font></a> On the next day, we, who were
Paul's companions, departed, and came to Caesarea.
<p>We entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the
seven, and stayed with him.  <a name="C21V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:9</font></a> Now this man had four virgin
daughters who prophesied.  <a name="C21V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:10</font></a> As we stayed there some days, a
certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.  <a name="C21V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:11</font></a> Coming to us, and taking Paul's
belt, he bound his own feet and hands, and said, &quot;Thus says the Holy
Spirit: 'So will the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt,
and will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:12</font></a> When we heard these
things, both we and they of that place begged him not to go up to
Jerusalem.  <a name="C21V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:13</font></a> Then Paul
answered, &quot;What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I
am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name
of the Lord Jesus.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:14</font></a> When he would not be
persuaded, we ceased, saying, &quot;The Lord's will be done.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:15</font></a> After these days we
took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.  <a name="C21V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:16</font></a> Some of the disciples from
Caesarea also went with us, bringing one Mnason of Cyprus, an early
disciple, with whom we would stay.
<p> <a name="C21V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:17</font></a> When we had come to
Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.  <a name="C21V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:18</font></a> The day following, Paul went in
with us to James; and all the elders were present.  <a name="C21V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:19</font></a> When he had greeted them, he
reported one by one the things which God had worked among the Gentiles
through his ministry.  <a name="C21V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:20</font></a> They, when they heard it,
glorified God. They said to him, &quot;You see, brother, how many
thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed, and they
are all zealous for the law.  <a name="C21V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:21</font></a> They have been informed about
you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake
Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after
the customs.  <a name="C21V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:22</font></a> What then?
The assembly must certainly meet, for they will hear that you have come.
 <a name="C21V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:23</font></a> Therefore do what we
tell you. We have four men who have taken a vow.  <a name="C21V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:24</font></a> Take them, and purify yourself
with them, and pay their expenses for them, that they may shave their
heads. Then all will know that there is no truth in the things that they
have been informed about you, but that you yourself also walk keeping the
law.  <a name="C21V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:25</font></a> But concerning the
Gentiles who believe, we have written our decision that they should
observe no such thing, except that they should keep themselves from food
offered to idols, from blood, from strangled things, and from sexual
immorality.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:26</font></a> Then Paul took the
men, and the next day, purified himself and went with them into the
temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the
offering was offered for every one of them.  <a name="C21V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:27</font></a> When the seven days were almost
completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up
all the multitude and laid hands on him,  <a name="C21V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:28</font></a> crying out, &quot;Men of Israel,
help! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people,
and the law, and this place. Moreover, he also brought Greeks into the
temple, and has defiled this holy place!&quot;  <a name="C21V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:29</font></a> For they had seen Trophimus, the
Ephesian, with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought
him into the temple.
<p> <a name="C21V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:30</font></a> All the city was
moved, and the people ran together. They seized Paul and dragged him out
of the temple. Immediately the doors were shut.  <a name="C21V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:31</font></a> As they were trying to kill him,
news came up to the commanding officer of the regiment that all Jerusalem
was in an uproar.  <a name="C21V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:32</font></a> Immediately he took soldiers and
centurions, and ran down to them. They, when they saw the chief captain
and the soldiers, stopped beating Paul.  <a name="C21V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:33</font></a> Then the commanding officer came
near, arrested him, commanded him to be bound with two chains, and
inquired who he was and what he had done.  <a name="C21V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:34</font></a> Some shouted one thing, and some
another, among the crowd. When he couldn't find out the truth because of
the noise, he commanded him to be brought into the barracks.
<p> <a name="C21V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:35</font></a> When he came to the
stairs, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the
violence of the crowd;  <a name="C21V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:36</font></a> for the multitude of the people
followed after, crying out, &quot;Away with him!&quot;  <a name="C21V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:37</font></a> As Paul was about to be brought
into the barracks, he asked the commanding officer, &quot;May I speak to
you?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;Do you know Greek?  <a name="C21V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:38</font></a> Aren't you then the Egyptian,
who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the
wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:39</font></a> But Paul said,
&quot;I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant
city. I beg you, allow me to speak to the people.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:40</font></a> When he had given him
permission, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the
people. When there was a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew
language, saying,
<p> <a name="C22V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:1</font></a> &quot;Brothers and
fathers, listen to the defense which I now make to you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:2</font></a> When they heard that
he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they were even more quiet. He
said,  <a name="C22V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:3</font></a> &quot;I am indeed a
Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of
Gamaliel, instructed according to the strict manner of the law of our
fathers, being zealous for God, even as you all are this day.  <a name="C22V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:4</font></a> I persecuted this Way to the
death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.  <a name="C22V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:5</font></a> As also the high priest and all
the council of the elders testify, from whom also I received letters to
the brothers, and traveled to Damascus to bring them also who were there
to Jerusalem in bonds to be punished.  <a name="C22V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:6</font></a> It happened that, as I made my
journey, and came close to Damascus, about noon, suddenly there shone from
the sky a great light around me.  <a name="C22V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:7</font></a> I fell to the ground, and heard a
voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting
me?'  <a name="C22V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:8</font></a> I answered,
'Who are you, Lord?' He said to me, 'I am Jesus of
Nazareth, whom you persecute.'
<p> <a name="C22V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:9</font></a> &quot;Those who were
with me indeed saw the light and were afraid, but they didn't understand
the voice of him who spoke to me.  <a name="C22V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:10</font></a> I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?'
The Lord said to me, 'Arise, and go into Damascus. There
you will be told about all things which are appointed for you to
do.'  <a name="C22V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:11</font></a> When I
couldn't see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those
who were with me, I came into Damascus.  <a name="C22V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:12</font></a> One Ananias, a devout man
according to the law, well reported of by all the Jews who lived in
Damascus,  <a name="C22V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:13</font></a> came to me,
and standing by me said to me, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight!' In that
very hour I looked up at him.  <a name="C22V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:14</font></a> He said, 'The God of our fathers
has appointed you to know his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to
hear a voice from his mouth.  <a name="C22V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:15</font></a> For you will be a witness for
him to all men of what you have seen and heard.  <a name="C22V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:16</font></a> Now why do you wait? Arise, be
baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.'
<p> <a name="C22V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:17</font></a> &quot;It happened
that, when I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I prayed in the temple,
I fell into a trance,  <a name="C22V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:18</font></a> and saw him saying to me, 'Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not
receive testimony concerning me from you.'  <a name="C22V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:19</font></a> I said, 'Lord, they themselves
know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue those who believed in
you.  <a name="C22V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:20</font></a> When the blood of
Stephen, your witness, was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting to
his death, and guarding the cloaks of those who killed him.'
<p> <a name="C22V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:21</font></a> &quot;He said to me,
'Depart, for I will send you out far from here to the
Gentiles.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:22</font></a> They listened to him
until he said that; then they lifted up their voice, and said, &quot;Rid
the earth of this fellow, for he isn't fit to live!&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:23</font></a> As they cried out,
and threw off their cloaks, and threw dust into the air,  <a name="C22V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:24</font></a> the commanding officer commanded
him to be brought into the barracks, ordering him to be examined by
scourging, that he might know for what crime they shouted against him like
that.  <a name="C22V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:25</font></a> When they had tied
him up with thongs, Paul asked the centurion who stood by, &quot;Is it
lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and not found guilty?&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:26</font></a> When the centurion
heard it, he went to the commanding officer and told him, &quot;Watch what
you are about to do, for this man is a Roman!&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:27</font></a> The commanding
officer came and asked him, &quot;Tell me, are you a Roman?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;Yes.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:28</font></a> The commanding
officer answered, &quot;I bought my citizenship for a great price.&quot;
<p>Paul said, &quot;But I was born a Roman.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:29</font></a> Immediately those who
were about to examine him departed from him, and the commanding officer
also was afraid when he realized that he was a Roman, because he had bound
him.  <a name="C22V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:30</font></a> But on the next
day, desiring to know the truth about why he was accused by the Jews, he
freed him from the bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all the
council to come together, and brought Paul down and set him before them.
<p> <a name="C23V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:1</font></a> Paul, looking
steadfastly at the council, said, &quot;Brothers, I have lived before God
in all good conscience until this day.&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:2</font></a> The high priest,
Ananias, commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.
<p> <a name="C23V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:3</font></a> Then Paul said to him,
&quot;God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit to judge me
according to the law, and command me to be struck contrary to the
law?&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:4</font></a> Those who stood by
said, &quot;Do you malign God's high priest?&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:5</font></a> Paul said, &quot;I
didn't know, brothers, that he was high priest. For it is written, 'You
shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.'&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N72">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C23V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:6</font></a> But when Paul perceived that the
one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the
council, &quot;Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees.
Concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:7</font></a> When he had said this,
an argument arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly
was divided.  <a name="C23V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:8</font></a> For the
Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but
the Pharisees confess all of these.  <a name="C23V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:9</font></a> A great clamor arose, and some of
the scribes of the Pharisees part stood up, and contended, saying,
&quot;We find no evil in this man. But if a spirit or angel has spoken to
him, let's not fight against God!&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:10</font></a> When a great argument
arose, the commanding officer, fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces
by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from
among them, and bring him into the barracks.
<p> <a name="C23V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:11</font></a> The following night,
the Lord stood by him, and said, &quot;Cheer up, Paul, for
as you have testified about me at Jerusalem, so you must testify also at
Rome.&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:12</font></a> When it was day, some
of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying
that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.  <a name="C23V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:13</font></a> There were more than forty
people who had made this conspiracy.  <a name="C23V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:14</font></a> They came to the chief priests
and the elders, and said, &quot;We have bound ourselves under a great
curse, to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.  <a name="C23V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:15</font></a> Now therefore, you with the
council inform the commanding officer that he should bring him down to you
tomorrow, as though you were going to judge his case more exactly. We are
ready to kill him before he comes near.&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:16</font></a> But Paul's sister's
son heard of their lying in wait, and he came and entered into the
barracks and told Paul.  <a name="C23V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:17</font></a> Paul summoned one of the
centurions, and said, &quot;Bring this young man to the commanding
officer, for he has something to tell him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:18</font></a> So he took him, and
brought him to the commanding officer, and said, &quot;Paul, the prisoner,
summoned me and asked me to bring this young man to you, who has something
to tell you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:19</font></a> The commanding
officer took him by the hand, and going aside, asked him privately,
&quot;What is it that you have to tell me?&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:20</font></a> He said, &quot;The
Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as
though intending to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him.
 <a name="C23V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:21</font></a> Therefore don't yield to
them, for more than forty men lie in wait for him, who have bound
themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have
killed him. Now they are ready, looking for the promise from you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:22</font></a> So the commanding
officer let the young man go, charging him, &quot;Tell no one that you
have revealed these things to me.&quot;  <a name="C23V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:23</font></a> He called to himself two of the
centurions, and said, &quot;Prepare two hundred soldiers to go as far as
Caesarea, with seventy horsemen, and two hundred men armed with spears, at
<a href="#N73">the third hour of the night</a>.&quot;  <a name="C23V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:24</font></a> He asked them to provide
animals, that they might set Paul on one, and bring him safely to Felix
the governor.  <a name="C23V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:25</font></a> He wrote a
letter like this:
<p> <a name="C23V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:26</font></a> &quot;Claudius Lysias
to the most excellent governor Felix: Greetings.
<p> <a name="C23V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:27</font></a> &quot;This man was
seized by the Jews, and was about to be killed by them, when I came with
the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.  <a name="C23V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:28</font></a> Desiring to know the cause why
they accused him, I brought him down to their council.  <a name="C23V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:29</font></a> I found him to be accused about
questions of their law, but not to be charged with anything worthy of
death or of imprisonment.  <a name="C23V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:30</font></a> When I was told that the Jews
lay in wait for the man, I sent him to you immediately, charging his
accusers also to bring their accusations against him before you.
Farewell.&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:31</font></a> So the soldiers,
carrying out their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to
Antipatris.  <a name="C23V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:32</font></a> But on the
next day they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the
barracks.  <a name="C23V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:33</font></a> When they came
to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented
Paul to him.  <a name="C23V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:34</font></a> When the
governor had read it, he asked what province he was from. When he
understood that he was from Cilicia, he said,  <a name="C23V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:35</font></a> &quot;I will hear you fully when
your accusers also arrive.&quot; He commanded that he be kept in Herod's
palace.
<p> <a name="C24V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:1</font></a> After five days, the
high priest, Ananias, came down with certain elders and an orator, one
Tertullus. They informed the governor against Paul.  <a name="C24V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:2</font></a> When he was called, Tertullus
began to accuse him, saying, &quot;Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace,
and that excellent measures are coming to this nation,  <a name="C24V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:3</font></a> we accept it in all ways and in
all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.  <a name="C24V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:4</font></a> But, that I don't delay you, I
entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words.  <a name="C24V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:5</font></a> For we have found this man to be
a plague, an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the
world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.  <a name="C24V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:6</font></a> He even tried to profane the
temple, and we arrested him.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a

size=-1><sup><a href="#N76">*</a></sup></font>By examining him yourself
you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:9</font></a> The Jews also joined
in the attack, affirming that these things were so.  <a name="C24V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:10</font></a> When the governor had beckoned
to him to speak, Paul answered, &quot;Because I know that you have been a
judge of this nation for many years, I cheerfully make my defense,  <a name="C24V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:11</font></a> seeing that you can recognize
that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at
Jerusalem.  <a name="C24V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:12</font></a> In the temple
they didn't find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either
in the synagogues, or in the city.  <a name="C24V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:13</font></a> Nor can they prove to you the
things of which they now accuse me.  <a name="C24V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:14</font></a> But this I confess to you, that
after the Way, which they call a sect, so I serve the God of our fathers,
believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written
in the prophets;  <a name="C24V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:15</font></a> having
hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there will be
a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.  <a name="C24V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:16</font></a> Herein I also practice always
having a conscience void of offense toward God and men.  <a name="C24V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:17</font></a> Now after some years, I came to
bring gifts for the needy to my nation, and offerings;  <a name="C24V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:18</font></a> amid which certain Jews from
Asia found me purified in the temple, not with a mob, nor with turmoil.
 <a name="C24V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:19</font></a> They ought to have been
here before you, and to make accusation, if they had anything against me.
 <a name="C24V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:20</font></a> Or else let these men
themselves say what injustice they found in me when I stood before the
council,  <a name="C24V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:21</font></a> unless it is
for this one thing that I cried standing among them, 'Concerning the
resurrection of the dead I am being judged before you today!'&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:22</font></a> But Felix, having
more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, &quot;When
Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will decide your case.&quot;
 <a name="C24V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:23</font></a> He ordered the centurion
that Paul should be kept in custody, and should have some privileges, and
not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him.  <a name="C24V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:24</font></a> But after some days, Felix came
with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard
him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.  <a name="C24V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:25</font></a> As he reasoned about
righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was
terrified, and answered, &quot;Go your way for this time, and when it is
convenient for me, I will summon you.&quot;  <a name="C24V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:26</font></a> Meanwhile, he also hoped that
money would be given to him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore
also he sent for him more often, and talked with him.  <a name="C24V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:27</font></a> But when two years were
fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain
favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.
<p> <a name="C25V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:1</font></a> Festus therefore,
having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from
Caesarea.  <a name="C25V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:2</font></a> Then the high
priest and the principal men of the Jews informed him against Paul, and
they begged him,  <a name="C25V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:3</font></a> asking a
favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem; plotting to kill
him on the way.  <a name="C25V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:4</font></a> However
Festus answered that Paul should be kept in custody at Caesarea, and that
he himself was about to depart shortly.  <a name="C25V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:5</font></a> &quot;Let them therefore,&quot;
said he, &quot;that are in power among you go down with me, and if there
is anything wrong in the man, let them accuse him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C25V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:6</font></a> When he had stayed
among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea, and on the next
day he sat on the judgment seat, and commanded Paul to be brought.  <a name="C25V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:7</font></a> When he had come, the Jews who
had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing against him many
and grievous charges which they could not prove,  <a name="C25V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:8</font></a> while he said in his defense,
&quot;Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor
against Caesar, have I sinned at all.&quot;
<p> <a name="C25V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:9</font></a> But Festus, desiring
to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, &quot;Are you willing
to go up to Jerusalem, and be judged by me there concerning these
things?&quot;
<p> <a name="C25V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:10</font></a> But Paul said,
&quot;I am standing before Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be
tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also know very well.
 <a name="C25V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:11</font></a> For if I have done
wrong, and have committed anything worthy of death, I don't refuse to die;
but if none of those things is true that they accuse me of, no one can
give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar!&quot;
<p> <a name="C25V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:12</font></a> Then Festus, when he
had conferred with the council, answered, &quot;You have appealed to
Caesar. To Caesar you shall go.&quot;
<p> <a name="C25V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:13</font></a> Now when some days
had passed, Agrippa the King and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, and greeted
Festus.  <a name="C25V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:14</font></a> As he stayed
there many days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying,
&quot;There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix;  <a name="C25V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:15</font></a> about whom, when I was at
Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me,
asking for a sentence against him.  <a name="C25V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:16</font></a> To whom I answered that it is
not the custom of the Romans to give up any man to destruction, before the
accused has met the accusers face to face, and has had opportunity to make
his defense concerning the matter laid against him.  <a name="C25V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:17</font></a> When therefore they had come
together here, I didn't delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment
seat, and commanded the man to be brought.  <a name="C25V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:18</font></a> Concerning whom, when the
accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such things as I supposed;
 <a name="C25V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:19</font></a> but had certain
questions against him about their own religion, and about one Jesus, who
was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.  <a name="C25V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:20</font></a> Being perplexed how to inquire
concerning these things, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem
and there be judged concerning these matters.  <a name="C25V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:21</font></a> But when Paul had appealed to be
kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept until I
could send him to Caesar.&quot;
<p> <a name="C25V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:22</font></a> Agrippa said to
Festus, &quot;I also would like to hear the man myself.&quot;
<p>&quot;Tomorrow,&quot; he said, &quot;you shall hear him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C25V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:23</font></a> So on the next day,
when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp, and they had entered
into the place of hearing with the commanding officers and principal men
of the city, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.  <a name="C25V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:24</font></a> Festus said, &quot;King Agrippa,
and all men who are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all
the multitude of the Jews petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here,
crying that he ought not to live any longer.  <a name="C25V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:25</font></a> But when I found that he had
committed nothing worthy of death, and as he himself appealed to the
emperor I determined to send him.  <a name="C25V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:26</font></a> Of whom I have no certain thing
to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him forth before you, and
especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after examination, I may have
something to write.  <a name="C25V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:27</font></a> For
it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to also specify
the charges against him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:1</font></a> Agrippa said to Paul,
&quot;You may speak for yourself.&quot;
<p>Then Paul stretched out his hand, and made his defense.  <a name="C26V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:2</font></a> &quot;I think myself happy, King
Agrippa, that I am to make my defense before you this day concerning all
the things that I am accused by the Jews,  <a name="C26V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:3</font></a> especially because you are expert
in all customs and questions which are among the Jews. Therefore I beg you
to hear me patiently.
<p> <a name="C26V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:4</font></a> &quot;Indeed, all the
Jews know my way of life from my youth up, which was from the beginning
among my own nation and at Jerusalem;  <a name="C26V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:5</font></a> having known me from the first,
if they are willing to testify, that after the strictest sect of our
religion I lived a Pharisee.  <a name="C26V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:6</font></a> Now I stand here to be judged for
the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers,  <a name="C26V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:7</font></a> which our twelve tribes,
earnestly serving night and day, hope to attain. Concerning this hope I am
accused by the Jews, King Agrippa!  <a name="C26V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:8</font></a> Why is it judged incredible with
you, if God does raise the dead?
<p> <a name="C26V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:9</font></a> &quot;I myself most
certainly thought that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of
Jesus of Nazareth.  <a name="C26V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:10</font></a> This
I also did in Jerusalem. I both shut up many of the saints in prisons,
having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put
to death I gave my vote against them.  <a name="C26V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:11</font></a> Punishing them often in all the
synagogues, I tried to make them blaspheme. Being exceedingly enraged
against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.
<p> <a name="C26V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:12</font></a> &quot;Whereupon as I
traveled to Damascus with the authority and commission from the chief
priests,  <a name="C26V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:13</font></a> at noon, O
King, I saw on the way a light from the sky, brighter than the sun,
shining around me and those who traveled with me.  <a name="C26V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:14</font></a> When we had all fallen to the
earth, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to
kick against the goads.'
<p> <a name="C26V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:15</font></a> &quot;I said, 'Who
are you, Lord?'
<p>&quot;He said, 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.
 <a name="C26V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:16</font></a> But arise, and stand on
your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose: to appoint you a
servant and a witness both of the things which you have seen, and of the
things which I will reveal to you;  <a name="C26V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:17</font></a> delivering you from the people,
and from the Gentiles, to whom I send you,  <a name="C26V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:18</font></a> to open their eyes, that they
may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that
they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are
sanctified by faith in me.'
<p> <a name="C26V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:19</font></a> &quot;Therefore, King
Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,  <a name="C26V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:20</font></a> but declared first to them of
Damascus, at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judea, and also
to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works
worthy of repentance.  <a name="C26V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:21</font></a> For this reason the Jews seized
me in the temple, and tried to kill me.  <a name="C26V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:22</font></a> Having therefore obtained the
help that is from God, I stand to this day testifying both to small and
great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would happen,
 <a name="C26V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:23</font></a> how the Christ must
suffer, and how, by the resurrection of the dead, he would be first to
proclaim light both to these people and to the Gentiles.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:24</font></a> As he thus made his
defense, Festus said with a loud voice, &quot;Paul, you are crazy! Your
great learning is driving you insane!&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:25</font></a> But he said, &quot;I
am not crazy, most excellent Festus, but boldly declare words of truth and
reasonableness.  <a name="C26V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:26</font></a> For the
king knows of these things, to whom also I speak freely. For I am
persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him, for this has not
been done in a corner.  <a name="C26V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:27</font></a> King Agrippa, do you believe the
prophets? I know that you believe.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:28</font></a> Agrippa said to Paul,
&quot;With a little persuasion are you trying to make me a Christian?&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:29</font></a> Paul said, &quot;I
pray to God, that whether with little or with much, not only you, but also
all that hear me this day, might become such as I am, except for these
bonds.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:30</font></a> The king rose up with
the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them.  <a name="C26V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:31</font></a> When they had withdrawn, they
spoke one to another, saying, &quot;This man does nothing worthy of death
or of bonds.&quot;  <a name="C26V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:32</font></a> Agrippa said to Festus,
&quot;This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to
Caesar.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:1</font></a> When it was determined
that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other
prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan band.  <a name="C27V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:2</font></a> Embarking in a ship of
Adramyttium, which was about to sail to places on the coast of Asia, we
put to sea; Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
 <a name="C27V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:3</font></a> The next day, we touched
at Sidon. Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him permission to go to his
friends and refresh himself.  <a name="C27V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:4</font></a> Putting to sea from there, we
sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.  <a name="C27V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:5</font></a> When we had sailed across the sea
which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.
 <a name="C27V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:6</font></a> There the centurion found
a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy, and he put us on board.  <a name="C27V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:7</font></a> When we had sailed slowly many
days, and had come with difficulty opposite Cnidus, the wind not allowing
us further, we sailed under the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone.  <a name="C27V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:8</font></a> With difficulty sailing along it
we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.
<p> <a name="C27V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:9</font></a> When much time had
passed and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast had now already
gone by, Paul admonished them,  <a name="C27V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:10</font></a> and said to them, &quot;Sirs, I
perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of
the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.&quot;  <a name="C27V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:11</font></a> But the centurion gave more heed
to the master and to the owner of the ship than to those things which were
spoken by Paul.  <a name="C27V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:12</font></a> Because
the haven was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised going to sea
from there, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter there,
which is a port of Crete, looking northeast and southeast.
<p> <a name="C27V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:13</font></a> When the south wind
blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed
anchor and sailed along Crete, close to shore.  <a name="C27V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:14</font></a> But before long, a stormy wind
beat down from shore, which is called <a href="#N77">Euroclydon.</a>
 <a name="C27V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:15</font></a> When the ship was
caught, and couldn't face the wind, we gave way to it, and were driven
along.  <a name="C27V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:16</font></a> Running under the
lee of a small island called Clauda, we were able, with difficulty, to
secure the boat.  <a name="C27V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:17</font></a> After
they had hoisted it up, they used cables to help reinforce the ship.
Fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis sand bars, they lowered
the sea anchor, and so were driven along.  <a name="C27V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:18</font></a> As we labored exceedingly with
the storm, the next day they began to throw things overboard.  <a name="C27V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:19</font></a> On the third day, they threw out
the ship's tackle with their own hands.  <a name="C27V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:20</font></a> When neither sun nor stars shone
on us for many days, and no small storm pressed on us, all hope that we
would be saved was now taken away.
<p> <a name="C27V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:21</font></a> When they had been
long without food, Paul stood up in the middle of them, and said,
&quot;Sirs, you should have listened to me, and not have set sail from
Crete, and have gotten this injury and loss.  <a name="C27V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:22</font></a> Now I exhort you to cheer up,
for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.  <a name="C27V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:23</font></a> For there stood by me this night
an angel, belonging to the God whose I am and whom I serve,  <a name="C27V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:24</font></a> saying, 'Don't be afraid, Paul.
You must stand before Caesar. Behold, God has granted you all those who
sail with you.'  <a name="C27V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:25</font></a> Therefore, sirs, cheer up! For I
believe God, that it will be just as it has been spoken to me.  <a name="C27V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:26</font></a> But we must run aground on a
certain island.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:27</font></a> But when the
fourteenth night had come, as we were driven back and forth in the
Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing
near to some land.  <a name="C27V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:28</font></a> They
took soundings, and found <a href="#N78">twenty fathoms.</a> After a
little while, they took soundings again, and found <a href="#N79">fifteen
fathoms.</a>  <a name="C27V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:29</font></a> Fearing
that we would run aground on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from
the stern, and wished for daylight.  <a name="C27V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:30</font></a> As the sailors were trying to
flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, pretending
that they would lay out anchors from the bow,  <a name="C27V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:31</font></a> Paul said to the centurion and
to the soldiers, &quot;Unless these stay in the ship, you can't be
saved.&quot;  <a name="C27V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:32</font></a> Then the
soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off.
<p> <a name="C27V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:33</font></a> While the day was
coming on, Paul begged them all to take some food, saying, &quot;This day
is the fourteenth day that you wait and continue fasting, having taken
nothing.  <a name="C27V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:34</font></a> Therefore I beg
you to take some food, for this is for your safety; for not a hair will
perish from any of your heads.&quot;  <a name="C27V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:35</font></a> When he had said this, and had
taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all, and he broke
it, and began to eat.  <a name="C27V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:36</font></a> Then they all cheered up, and
they also took food.  <a name="C27V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:37</font></a> In
all, we were two hundred seventy-six souls on the ship.  <a name="C27V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:38</font></a> When they had eaten enough, they
lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.  <a name="C27V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:39</font></a> When it was day, they didn't
recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay with a beach, and they
decided to try to drive the ship onto it.  <a name="C27V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:40</font></a> Casting off the anchors, they
left them in the sea, at the same time untying the rudder ropes. Hoisting
up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.  <a name="C27V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:41</font></a> But coming to a place where two
seas met, they ran the vessel aground. The bow struck and remained
immovable, but the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves.
<p> <a name="C27V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:42</font></a> The soldiers' counsel
was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would swim out and escape.
 <a name="C27V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:43</font></a> But the centurion,
desiring to save Paul, stopped them from their purpose, and commanded that
those who could swim should throw themselves overboard first to go toward
the land;  <a name="C27V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:44</font></a> and the rest
should follow, some on planks, and some on other things from the ship. So
it happened that they all escaped safely to the land.
<p> <a name="C28V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:1</font></a> When we had escaped,
then <a href="#N80">they</a> learned that the island was called Malta.
 <a name="C28V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:2</font></a> The natives showed us
uncommon kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because
of the present rain, and because of the cold.  <a name="C28V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:3</font></a> But when Paul had gathered a
bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of
the heat, and fastened on his hand.  <a name="C28V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:4</font></a> When the natives saw the creature
hanging from his hand, they said one to another, &quot;No doubt this man
is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped from the sea, yet Justice has
not allowed to live.&quot;  <a name="C28V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:5</font></a> However he shook off the creature
into the fire, and wasn't harmed.  <a name="C28V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:6</font></a> But they expected that he would
have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly, but when they watched for a
long time and saw nothing bad happen to him, they changed their minds, and
said that he was a god.
<p> <a name="C28V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:7</font></a> Now in the
neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the
island, named Publius, who received us, and courteously entertained us for
three days.  <a name="C28V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:8</font></a> It happened
that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery. Paul entered
in to him, prayed, and laying his hands on him, healed him.  <a name="C28V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:9</font></a> Then when this was done, the rest
also who had diseases in the island came, and were cured.  <a name="C28V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:10</font></a> They also honored us with many
honors, and when we sailed, they put on board the things that we needed.
<p> <a name="C28V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:11</font></a> After three months,
we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island,
whose sign was &quot;The Twin Brothers.&quot;  <a name="C28V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:12</font></a> Touching at Syracuse, we stayed
there three days.  <a name="C28V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:13</font></a> From
there we circled around and arrived at Rhegium. After one day, a south
wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli,  <a name="C28V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:14</font></a> where we found <a
href="#N81">brothers,</a> and were entreated to stay with them for seven
days. So we came to Rome.  <a name="C28V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:15</font></a> From there the brothers, when
they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The
Three Taverns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God, and took courage.
 <a name="C28V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:16</font></a> When we entered into
Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard,
but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him.
<p> <a name="C28V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:17</font></a> It happened that
after three days Paul called together those who were the leaders of the
Jews. When they had come together, he said to them, &quot;I, brothers,
though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our
fathers, still was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the
Romans,  <a name="C28V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:18</font></a> who, when they
had examined me, desired to set me free, because there was no cause of
death in me.  <a name="C28V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:19</font></a> But when
the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar, not that
I had anything about which to accuse my nation.  <a name="C28V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:20</font></a> For this cause therefore I asked
to see you and to speak with you. For because of the hope of Israel I am
bound with this chain.&quot;
<p> <a name="C28V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:21</font></a> They said to him,
&quot;We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor did any
of the brothers come here and report or speak any evil of you.  <a name="C28V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:22</font></a> But we desire to hear from you
what you think. For, as concerning this sect, it is known to us that
everywhere it is spoken against.&quot;
<p> <a name="C28V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:23</font></a> When they had
appointed him a day, many people came to him at his lodging. He explained
to them, testifying about the Kingdom of God, and persuading them
concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from
morning until evening.  <a name="C28V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:24</font></a> Some believed the things which
were spoken, and some disbelieved.  <a name="C28V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:25</font></a> When they didn't agree among
themselves, they departed after Paul had spoken one word, &quot;The Holy
Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah, the prophet, to our fathers,  <a name="C28V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:26</font></a> saying,
<dl>
<dt>'Go to this people, and say,
<dt>in hearing, you will hear,
<dd>but will in no way understand.
<dt>In seeing, you will see,
<dd>but will in no way perceive.
<dt> <a name="C28V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:27</font></a> For this people's
heart has grown callous.
<dd>Their ears are dull of hearing.
<dd>Their eyes they have closed.
<dt>Lest they should see with their eyes,
<dd>hear with their ears,
<dd>understand with their heart,
<dd>and would turn again,
<dd>and I would heal them.'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N82">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C28V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:28</font></a> &quot;Be it known
therefore to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the nations. They
will also listen.&quot;
<p> <a name="C28V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:29</font></a> When he had said
these words, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves.
<p> <a name="C28V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:30</font></a> Paul stayed two whole
years in his own rented house, and received all who were coming to him,
 <a name="C28V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:31</font></a> preaching the Kingdom of
God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all
boldness, without hindrance.

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>In answer to various questions we have received on this:</p>

<p>We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally<br>
request donations in all 50 states. If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with<br>

fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth<br>
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
