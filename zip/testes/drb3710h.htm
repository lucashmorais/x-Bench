<h1>Book 37 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonas</h1>
<br><br>




<p>THE PROPHECY OF JONAS</p>

<p>JONAS prophesied in the reign of JEREBOAM the second: as we learn from 4<br>
Kings 14.25. To whom also he foretold his success in restoring all the<br>
borders of Israel. He was of GETH OPHER in the tribe of ZABULON, and<br>
consequently of GALILEE: which confutes that assertion of the Pharisees,<br>
John 7.52, that no prophet ever rose out of GALILEE. He prophesied and<br>
prefigured in his own person the death and resurrection of CHRIST: and<br>
was the only one among the prophets that was sent to preach to the<br>
Gentiles.</p>

<p>
Jonas Chapter 1</p>

<p>Jonas being sent to preach in Ninive, fleeth away by sea: a tempest<br>
riseth: of which he being found, by lot, to be the cause, is cast into<br>
the sea, which thereupon is calmed.</p>

<p>1:1. Now the word of the Lord came to Jonas, the son of Amathi, saying:</p>

<p>1:2. Arise and go to Ninive, the great city, and preach in it: For the<br>
wickedness thereof is come up before me.</p>

<p>Nineve... The capital city of the Assyrian empire.</p>

<p>1:3. And Jonas rose up to flee into Tharsis from the face of the Lord,<br>
and he went down to Joppe, and found a ship going to Tharsis: and he<br>
paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them to Tharsis<br>
from the face of the Lord,</p>

<p>Tharsis... Which some take to be Tharsus of Cilicia, others to be<br>
Tartessus of Spain, others to be Carthage.</p>

<p>1:4. But the Lord sent a great wind to the sea: and a great tempest was<br>
raised in the sea, and the ship was in danger to be broken.</p>

<p>1:5. And the mariners were afraid, and the men cried to their god: and<br>
they cast forth the wares that were in the ship, into the sea, to<br>
lighten it of them: and Jonas went down into the inner part of the ship,<br>
and fell into a deep sleep.</p>

<p>A deep sleep... This is a lively image of the insensibility of sinners,<br>
fleeing from God, and threatened on every side with his judgments: and<br>
yet sleeping as if they were secure.</p>

<p>1:6. And the ship master came to him and said to him: Why art thou fast<br>
asleep? rise up call upon thy God, if so be that God will think of us<br>
that we may not perish.</p>

<p>1:7. And they said every one to his fellow: Come and let us cast lots,<br>
that we may know why this evil is upon us. &nbsp;And they cast lots, and the<br>
lot fell upon Jonas.</p>

<p>1:8. And they said to him: Tell us for what cause this evil is upon us,<br>
what is thy business? of what country art thou? and whither goest thou?<br>
or of what people art thou?</p>

<p>1:9. And he said to them: I am a Hebrew, and I fear the Lord, and the<br>
God of heaven, who made both the sea and the dry land.</p>

<p>1:10. And the men were greatly afraid, and they said to him: Why hast<br>
thou done this? (For the men knew that he fled from the face of the<br>
Lord: because he had told them.)</p>

<p>1:11. And they said to him: What shall we do with thee, that the sea may<br>
be calm to us? for the sea flowed and swelled.</p>

<p>1:12. And he said to them: take me up, and cast me into the sea, and the<br>
sea shall be calm to you: for I know for my sake this great tempest is<br>
upon you.</p>

<p>1:13. And the men rowed hard to return the land, but they were not able:<br>
because the sea tossed and swelled upon them.</p>

<p>1:14. And they cried to the Lord, and said: We beseech thee, O Lord let<br>
us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood:<br>
for thou, oh Lord, hast done as it pleased thee.</p>

<p>1:15. And they took Jonas, and cast him into the sea, and the sea ceased<br>
from raging.</p>

<p>1:16. And the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and sacrificed victims to<br>
the Lord, and made vows.</p>

<p>Jonas Chapter 2</p>

<p>Jonas is swallowed up by a great fish: he prayeth with confidence in<br>
God; and the fish casteth him out on the dry land.</p>

<p>2:1. Now the Lord prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonas: and Jonas<br>
was in the belly of a fish for three days and three nights.</p>

<p>2:2. And Jonas prayed to the Lord, his God, out of the belly of the<br>
fish.</p>

<p>2:3. And he said: I cried out of my affliction to the Lord, and he heard<br>
me: I cried out of the belly of hell, and thou hast heard my voice.</p>

<p>2:4. And thou hast cast me forth into the deep, in the heart of the sea,<br>
and a flood hast compassed me: all thy billows, and thy waves have<br>
passed over me.</p>

<p>2:5. And I said: I am cast away out of the sight of thy eyes: but yet I<br>
shall see the holy temple again.</p>

<p>2:6. The waters compassed me about even to the soul: the deep hath<br>
closed me round about, the sea hath covered my head.</p>

<p>2:7. I went down to the lowest parts of the mountains: the bars of the<br>
earth have shut me up for ever: and thou wilt bring up my life from<br>
corruption, O Lord, my God.</p>

<p>2:8. When my soul was in distress within me, I remembered the Lord: that<br>
my prayer may come to thee, unto the holy temple.</p>

<p>2:9. They that in vain observe vanities, forsake their own mercy.</p>

<p>2:10. But I with the voice of praise will sacrifice to thee: I will pay<br>
whatsoever I have vowed for my salvation to the Lord.</p>

<p>2:11. And the Lord spoke to the fish: and it vomited out Jonas upon the<br>
dry land.</p>

<p>Spoke to the fish... God's speaking to the fish, was nothing else but<br>
his will, which all things obey.</p>

<p>Jonas Chapter 3</p>

<p>Jonas is sent again to preach in Ninive. Upon their fasting and<br>
repentance, God recalleth the sentence by which they were to be<br>
destroyed.</p>

<p>
3:1. And the word of the Lord came to Jonas the second time saying:</p>

<p>3:2. Arise, and go to Ninive, the great city: and preach in it the<br>
preaching that I bid thee.</p>

<p>3:3. And Jonas arose, and went to Ninive, according to the word of the<br>
Lord: now Ninive was a great city of three days' journey.</p>

<p>Of three days' journey... By the computation of some ancient historians,<br>
Ninive was about fifty miles round: so that to go through all the chief<br>
streets and public places was three days' journey.</p>

<p>3:4. And Jonas began to enter into the city one day's journey: and he<br>
cried and said: Yet forty days and Ninive shall be destroyed.</p>

<p>3:5. And the men of Ninive believed in God: and they proclaimed a fast,<br>
and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least.</p>

<p>3:6. And the word came to the king of Ninive: and he rose up out of his<br>
throne, and cast away his robe from him, and was clothed in sackcloth,<br>
and sat in ashes.</p>

<p>3:7. And he caused it to be proclaimed and published in Ninive, from the<br>
mouth of the king and of his princes, saying: Let neither men nor<br>
beasts, oxen, nor sheep taste anything: let them not feed, nor drink<br>
water.</p>

<p>3:8. And let men and beasts be covered with sackcloth, and cry to the<br>
Lord with all their strength, and let them turn every one from his evil<br>
way, and from the iniquity that is in their hands.</p>

<p>3:9. Who can tell if God will turn, and forgive: and will turn away from<br>
his fierce anger, and we shall not perish?</p>

<p>3:10. And God saw their works, that they were turned from their evil<br>
way: and God had mercy with regard to the evil which he had said that he<br>
would do to them, and he did it not.</p>

<p>Jonas Chapter 4</p>

<p>4:1. And Jonas was exceedingly troubled, and was angry:</p>

<p>Was exceedingly troubled, etc... His concern was lest he should pass for<br>
a false prophet; or rather, lest God's word, by this occasion, might<br>
come to be slighted and disbelieved.</p>

<p>4:2. And he prayed to the Lord, and said: I beseech thee, O Lord, is not<br>
this what I said, when I was yet in my own country? therefore I went<br>
before to flee into Tharsis: for I know that thou art a gracious and<br>
merciful God, patient, and of much compassion, and easy to forgive evil.</p>

<p>4:3. And now, O Lord, I beseech thee take my life from me: for it is<br>
better for me to die than to live.</p>

<p>4:4. And the Lord said: Dost thou think thou hast reason to be angry?</p>

<p>4:5. Then Jonas went out of the city, and sat toward the east side of<br>
the city: and he made himself a booth there, and he sat under it in the<br>
shadow, till he might see what would befall the city.</p>

<p>4:6. And the Lord God prepared an ivy, and it came up over the head of<br>
Jonas, to be a shadow over his head, and to cover him (for he was<br>
fatigued): and Jonas was exceeding glad of the ivy.</p>

<p>The Lord God prepared an ivy... Hederam. In the Hebrew it is Kikajon,<br>
which some render a gourd: others a palmerist, or palma Christi.</p>

<p>4:7. But God prepared a worm, when the morning arose on the following<br>
day: and it struck the ivy and it withered.</p>

<p>4:8. And when the sun was risen, the Lord commanded a hot and burning<br>
wind: and the sun beat upon the head of Jonas, and he broiled with the<br>
heat: and he desired for his soul that he might die, and said: It is<br>
better for me to die than to live.</p>

<p>4:9. And the Lord said to Jonas: Dost thou think thou hast reason to be<br>
angry, for the ivy? And he said: I am angry with reason even unto death.</p>

<p>4:10. And the Lord said: Thou art grieved for the ivy, for which thou<br>
hast not laboured, nor made it to grow, which in one night came up, and<br>
in one night perished.</p>

<p>4:11. And shall I not spare Ninive, that great city, in which there are<br>
more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons, that know not how to<br>
distinguish between their right hand and their left, and many beasts?</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
