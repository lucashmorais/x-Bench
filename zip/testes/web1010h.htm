<h1>
The Second Book of Samuel
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> It happened after the
death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the
Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> it happened on the third day, that
behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes torn, and
earth on his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to
the earth, and did obeisance.  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> David said to him, From whence
come you? He said to him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> David said to him, How went the
matter? Please tell me. He answered, The people are fled from the battle,
and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his
son are dead also.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> David
said to the young man who told him, How know you that Saul and Jonathan
his son are dead?  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> The
young man who told him said, As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa,
behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and behold, the chariots and the
horsemen followed hard after him.  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> When he looked behind him, he saw
me, and called to me. I answered, Here am I.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> He said to me, Who are you? I
answered him, I am an Amalekite.  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> He said to me, Stand, I pray you,
beside me, and kill me; for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life
is yet whole in me.  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> So I
stood beside him, and killed him, because I was sure that he could not
live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was on his head,
and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my
lord.  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> Then David took
hold on his clothes, and tore them; and likewise all the men who were with
him:  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> and they mourned,
and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and
for the people of Yahweh, and for the house of Israel; because they were
fallen by the sword.  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> David said to the young man who
told him, Whence are you? He answered, I am the son of a foreigner, an
Amalekite.  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> David said to
him, How were you not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy Yahweh's
anointed?  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> David called
one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall on him. He struck him,
so that he died.  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> David
said to him, Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified
against you, saying, I have slain Yahweh's anointed.
<p> <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> David lamented with
this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son  <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> (and he bade them teach the
children of Judah <I>the song of</I> the bow: behold, it is written in the
book of Jashar):
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> Your glory, Israel,
is slain on your high places!
<dd>How the mighty have fallen!
<dt> <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> Don't tell it in Gath.
<dd>Don't publish it in the streets of Ashkelon,
<dt>lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,
<dd>lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
<dt> <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> You mountains of
Gilboa,
<dd>let there be no dew nor rain on you, neither fields of offerings;
<dd>For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away,
<dd>The shield of Saul was not anointed with oil.
<dt> <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> From the blood of the
slain,
<dd>from the fat of the mighty,
<dd>Jonathan's bow didn't turn back.
<dd>Saul's sword didn't return empty.
<dt> <a name="C1V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:23</font></a> Saul and Jonathan
were lovely and pleasant in their lives.
<dd>In their death, they were not divided.
<dt>They were swifter than eagles.
<dd>They were stronger than lions.
<dt> <a name="C1V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:24</font></a> You daughters of
Israel, weep over Saul,
<dd>who clothed you in scarlet delicately,
<dd>who put ornaments of gold on your clothing.
<dt> <a name="C1V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:25</font></a> How are the mighty
fallen in the midst of the battle!
<dd>Jonathan is slain on your high places.
<dt> <a name="C1V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:26</font></a> I am distressed for
you, my brother Jonathan.
<dd>You have been very pleasant to me.
<dd>Your love to me was wonderful,
<dd>passing the love of women.
<dt> <a name="C1V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:27</font></a> How are the mighty
fallen,
<dd>and the weapons of war perished!
</dl>
<p>  <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> It happened after
this, that David inquired of Yahweh, saying, Shall I go up into any of the
cities of Judah? Yahweh said to him, Go up. David said, Where shall I go
up? He said, To Hebron.  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> So
David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and
Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> His men who were with him did
David bring up, every man with his household: and they lived in the cities
of Hebron.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> The men of
Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah.
They told David, saying, The men of Jabesh Gilead were those who buried
Saul.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> David sent
messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said to them, Blessed be you
of Yahweh, that you have shown this kindness to your lord, even to Saul,
and have buried him.  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> Now
Yahweh show loving kindness and truth to you: and I also will requite you
this kindness, because you have done this thing.  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> Now therefore let your hands be
strong, and be you valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house
of Judah have anointed me king over them.  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> Now Abner the son of Ner, captain
of Saul's army, had taken Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over
to Mahanaim;  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> and he made
him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over
Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> Ishbosheth, Saul's son, was forty
years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years.
But the house of Judah followed David.  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> The time that David was king in
Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> Abner the son of Ner, and the
servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
 <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> Joab the son of Zeruiah,
and the servants of David, went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon;
and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on
the other side of the pool.  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> Abner said to Joab, Please let
the young men arise and play before us. Joab said, Let them arise.  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> Then they arose and went over by
number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and
twelve of the servants of David.  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> They caught everyone his fellow
by the head, and <I>thrust</I> his sword in his fellow's side; so they
fell down together: therefore that place was called Helkath Hazzurim,
which is in Gibeon.  <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> The
battle was very severe that day: and Abner was beaten, and the men of
Israel, before the servants of David.  <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> The three sons of Zeruiah were
there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a
wild gazelle.  <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> Asahel
pursued after Abner; and in going he didn't turn to the right hand nor to
the left from following Abner.  <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> Then Abner looked behind him, and
said, Is it you, Asahel? He answered, It is I.  <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> Abner said to him, Turn you aside
to your right hand or to your left, and lay you hold on one of the young
men, and take you his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from
following him.  <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> Abner said
again to Asahel, Turn you aside from following me: why should I strike you
to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab your brother?
 <a name="C2V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:23</font></a> However he refused to
turn aside: therefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear struck him in
the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there,
and died in the same place: and it happened, that as many as came to the
place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.  <a name="C2V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:24</font></a> But Joab and Abishai pursued
after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of
Ammah, that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
 <a name="C2V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:25</font></a> The children of Benjamin
gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood
on the top of a hill.  <a name="C2V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:26</font></a> Then Abner called to Joab, and
said, &quot;Shall the sword devour forever? Don't you know that it will be
bitterness in the latter end? How long shall it be then, before you bid
the people return from following their brothers?&quot;  <a name="C2V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:27</font></a> Joab said, As God lives, if you
had not spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone away, nor
followed everyone his brother.  <a name="C2V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:28</font></a> So Joab blew the trumpet; and all
the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought
they any more.  <a name="C2V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:29</font></a> Abner and
his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the
Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.  <a name="C2V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:30</font></a> Joab returned from following
Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of
David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.  <a name="C2V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:31</font></a> But the servants of David had
struck of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, <I>so that</I> three hundred sixty
men died.  <a name="C2V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:32</font></a> They took up
Asahel, and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was in Bethlehem.
Joab and his men went all night, and the day broke on them at Hebron.
<p>  <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Now there was long war
between the house of Saul and the house of David: and David grew stronger
and stronger, but the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> To David were sons born in Hebron:
and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> and his second, Chileab, of
Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of
Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> and the fourth, Adonijah the son
of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah,
David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> It happened, while there was war
between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself
strong in the house of Saul.  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> Now Saul had a concubine, whose
name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and <I>Ishbosheth</I> said to
Abner, Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> Then was Abner very angry for the
words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head that belongs to Judah?
This day do I show kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his
brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of
David; and yet you charge me this day with a fault concerning this woman.
 <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> God do so to Abner, and
more also, if, as Yahweh has sworn to David, I don't do even so to him;
 <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> to transfer the kingdom
from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and
over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> He could not answer Abner another
word, because he feared him.  <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> Abner sent messengers to David on
his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying <I>also</I>, Make your
league with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you, to bring about all
Israel to you.  <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> He said,
Well; I will make a league with you; but one thing I require of you: that
is, you shall not see my face, except you first bring Michal, Saul's
daughter, when you come to see my face.  <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> David sent messengers to
Ishbosheth, Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I pledged
to be married to me for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines.  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> Ishbosheth sent, and took her
from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish.  <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> Her husband went with her,
weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then said Abner to him,
Go, return: and he returned.  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> Abner had communication with the
elders of Israel, saying, In times past you sought for David to be king
over you:  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> now then do it;
for Yahweh has spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I
will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of
the hand of all their enemies.  <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> Abner also spoke in the ears of
Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all
that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.  <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> So Abner came to David to Hebron,
and twenty men with him. David made Abner and the men who were with him a
feast.  <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> Abner said to
David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the
king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over
all that your soul desires. David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
 <a name="C3V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:22</font></a> Behold, the servants of
David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them:
but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he
was gone in peace.  <a name="C3V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:23</font></a> When
Joab and all the army who was with him had come, they told Joab, saying,
Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he is
gone in peace.  <a name="C3V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:24</font></a> Then Joab
came to the king, and said, What have you done? behold, Abner came to you;
why is it that you have sent him away, and he is quite gone?  <a name="C3V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:25</font></a> You know Abner the son of Ner,
that he came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming
in, and to know all that you do.  <a name="C3V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:26</font></a> When Joab was come out from
David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the
well of Sirah: but David didn't know it.  <a name="C3V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:27</font></a> When Abner was returned to
Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him
quietly, and struck him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood
of Asahel his brother.  <a name="C3V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:28</font></a> Afterward, when David heard it,
he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before Yahweh forever of the blood
of Abner the son of Ner:  <a name="C3V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:29</font></a> let it fall on the head of Joab,
and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of
Joab one who has an issue, or who is a leper, or who leans on a staff, or
who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.  <a name="C3V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:30</font></a> So Joab and Abishai his brother
killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the
battle.  <a name="C3V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:31</font></a> David said to
Joab, and to all the people who were with him, Tear your clothes, and gird
you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. King David followed the bier.
 <a name="C3V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:32</font></a> They buried Abner in
Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner;
and all the people wept.  <a name="C3V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:33</font></a> The king lamented for Abner, and
said, Should Abner die as a fool dies?  <a name="C3V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:34</font></a> Your hands were not bound, nor
your feet put into fetters. As a man falls before the children of
iniquity, so you fell.
<p>All the people wept again over him.  <a name="C3V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:35</font></a> All the people came to cause
David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying, God do
so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or anything else, until the sun
be down.  <a name="C3V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:36</font></a> All the people
took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatever the king did pleased
all the people.  <a name="C3V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:37</font></a> So all
the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king
to kill Abner the son of Ner.  <a name="C3V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:38</font></a> The king said to his servants,
&quot;Don't you know that there a prince and a great man has fallen this
day in Israel?  <a name="C3V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:39</font></a> I am this
day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too
hard for me. May Yahweh reward the evil-doer according to his
wickedness.&quot;
<p>  <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> When
<I>Ishbosheth</I>, Saul's son, heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his
hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> <I>Ishbosheth</I>, Saul's son,
<I>had</I> two men who were captains of bands: the name of the one was
Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the
Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth also is reckoned to
Benjamin:  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> and the
Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have lived as foreigners there until this
day).  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> Now Jonathan, Saul's
son, had a son who was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the
news came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel; and his nurse took him up,
and fled: and it happened, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and
became lame. His name was Mephibosheth.  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> The sons of Rimmon the Beerothite,
Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house
of Ishbosheth, as he took his rest at noon.  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> They came there into the midst of
the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they struck him in
the body: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> Now when they came into the house,
as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, they struck him, and killed him,
and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all
night.  <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> They brought the
head of Ishbosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold, the
head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life; and
Yahweh has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.
 <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> David answered Rechab and
Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them,
As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> when one told me, saying, Behold,
Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good news, I took hold of him, and
killed him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news.
 <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> How much more, when
wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house on his bed,
shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the
earth?  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> David commanded
his young men, and they killed them, and cut off their hands and their
feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head
of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.
<p> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> Then came all the
tribes of Israel to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we are
your bone and your flesh.  <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> In times past, when Saul was king
over us, it was you who led out and brought in Israel: and Yahweh said to
you, You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince
over Israel.  <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> So all the
elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a
covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh: and they anointed David king
over Israel.  <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> David was
thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
 <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> In Hebron he reigned over
Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three
years over all Israel and Judah.  <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> The king and his men went to
Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to
David, saying, Except you take away the blind and the lame, you shall not
come in here; thinking, David can't come in here.  <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> Nevertheless David took the
stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.  <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> David said on that day, Whoever
strikes the Jebusites, let him get up to the watercourse, and
<I>strike</I> the lame and the blind, who are hated of David's soul.
Therefore they say, There are the blind and the lame; he can't come into
the house.  <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> David lived in
the stronghold, and called it the city of David. David built around from
Millo and inward.  <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> David
grew greater and greater; for Yahweh, the God of Armies, was with him.
 <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> Hiram king of Tyre sent
messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they
built David a house.  <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> David perceived that Yahweh had
established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for
his people Israel's sake.  <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> David took him more concubines
and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron; and there were
yet sons and daughters born to David.  <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> These are the names of those who
were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and
Solomon,  <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> and Ibhar, and
Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,  <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> and Elishama, and Eliada, and
Eliphelet.  <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> When the
Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the
Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to
the stronghold.  <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> Now the
Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
 <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> David inquired of Yahweh,
saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? will you deliver them into
my hand? Yahweh said to David, Go up; for I will certainly deliver the
Philistines into your hand.  <a name="C5V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:20</font></a> David came to Baal Perazim, and
David struck them there; and he said, Yahweh has broken my enemies before
me, like the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place
Baal Perazim.  <a name="C5V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:21</font></a> They left
their images there; and David and his men took them away.  <a name="C5V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:22</font></a> The Philistines came up yet
again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.  <a name="C5V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:23</font></a> When David inquired of Yahweh, he
said, You shall not go up: make a circuit behind them, and come on them
over against the mulberry trees.  <a name="C5V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:24</font></a> It shall be, when you hear the
sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall
bestir yourself; for then is Yahweh gone out before you to strike the army
of the Philistines.  <a name="C5V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:25</font></a> David
did so, as Yahweh commanded him, and struck the Philistines from Geba
until you come to Gezer.
<p>  <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> David again gathered
together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> David arose, and went with all the
people who were with him, from Baale Judah, to bring up from there the ark
of God, which is called by the Name, even the name of Yahweh of Armies who
sits <I>above</I> the cherubim.  <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> They set the ark of God on a new
cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill:
and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.  <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> They brought it out of the house
of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of God: and Ahio went
before the ark.  <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> David and
all the house of Israel played before Yahweh with all manner of
<I>instruments made of</I> fir wood, and with harps, and with stringed
instruments, and with tambourines, and with castanets, and with cymbals.
 <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> When they came to the
threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah put forth <I>his hand</I> to the ark of
God, and took hold of it; for the cattle stumbled.  <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> The anger of Yahweh was kindled
against Uzzah; and God struck him there for his error; and there he died
by the ark of God.  <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> David
was displeased, because Yahweh had broken forth on Uzzah; and he called
that place Perez Uzzah, to this day.  <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> David was afraid of Yahweh that
day; and he said, How shall the ark of Yahweh come to me?  <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> So David would not remove the ark
of Yahweh to him into the city of David; but David carried it aside into
the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.  <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> The ark of Yahweh remained in the
house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months: and Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom,
and all his house.  <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> It was
told king David, saying, Yahweh has blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and
all that pertains to him, because of the ark of God. David went and
brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom into the city of
David with joy.  <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> It was
so, that, when those who bore the ark of Yahweh had gone six paces, he
sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf.  <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> David danced before Yahweh with
all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.  <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> So David and all the house of
Israel brought up the ark of Yahweh with shouting, and with the sound of
the trumpet.  <a name="C6V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:16</font></a> It was so,
as the ark of Yahweh came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter
of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David leaping and dancing
before Yahweh; and she despised him in her heart.  <a name="C6V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:17</font></a> They brought in the ark of
Yahweh, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had
pitched for it; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings
before Yahweh.  <a name="C6V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:18</font></a> When David
had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he
blessed the people in the name of Yahweh of Armies.  <a name="C6V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:19</font></a> He dealt among all the people,
even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to
everyone a cake of bread, and a portion <I>of flesh</I>, and a cake of
raisins. So all the people departed everyone to his house.  <a name="C6V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:20</font></a> Then David returned to bless his
household. Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said,
How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself today in
the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows
shamelessly uncovers himself!  <a name="C6V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:21</font></a> David said to Michal, <I>It
was</I> before Yahweh, who chose me above your father, and above all his
house, to appoint me prince over the people of Yahweh, over Israel:
therefore will I play before Yahweh.  <a name="C6V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:22</font></a> I will be yet more vile than
this, and will be base in my own sight: but of the handmaids of whom you
have spoken, they shall honor me.  <a name="C6V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:23</font></a> Michal the daughter of Saul had
no child to the day of her death.
<p>
<p>  <a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> It happened, when the
king lived in his house, and Yahweh had given him rest from all his
enemies all around,  <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> that
the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar,
but the ark of God dwells within curtains.  <a name="C7V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:3</font></a> Nathan said to the king, Go, do
all that is in your heart; for Yahweh is with you.  <a name="C7V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:4</font></a> It happened the same night, that
the word of Yahweh came to Nathan, saying,  <a name="C7V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:5</font></a> Go and tell my servant David, Thus
says Yahweh, Shall you build me a house for me to dwell in?  <a name="C7V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:6</font></a> for I have not lived in a house
since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even
to this day, but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle.  <a name="C7V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:7</font></a> In all places in which I have
walked with all the children of Israel, spoke I a word with any of the
tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel,
saying, Why have you not built me a house of cedar?  <a name="C7V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:8</font></a> Now therefore thus you shall tell
my servant David, Thus says Yahweh of Armies, I took you from the sheep
pen, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people,
over Israel;  <a name="C7V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:9</font></a> and I have
been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from
before you; and I will make you a great name, like the name of the great
ones who are in the earth.  <a name="C7V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:10</font></a> I will appoint a place for my
people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own
place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness
afflict them any more, as at the first,  <a name="C7V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:11</font></a> and <I>as</I> from the day that I
commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will cause you to rest
from all your enemies. Moreover Yahweh tells you that Yahweh will make you
a house.  <a name="C7V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:12</font></a> When your days
are fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your
seed after you, who shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish
his kingdom.  <a name="C7V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:13</font></a> He shall
build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom
forever.  <a name="C7V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:14</font></a> I will be his
father, and he shall be my son: if he commit iniquity, I will chasten him
with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men;  <a name="C7V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:15</font></a> but my loving kindness shall not
depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before you.
 <a name="C7V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:16</font></a> Your house and your
kingdom shall be made sure for ever before you: your throne shall be
established forever.  <a name="C7V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:17</font></a> According to all these words, and
according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.  <a name="C7V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:18</font></a> Then David the king went in, and
sat before Yahweh; and he said, Who am I, Lord Yahweh, and what is my
house, that you have brought me thus far?  <a name="C7V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:19</font></a> This was yet a small thing in
your eyes, Lord Yahweh; but you have spoken also of your servant's house
for a great while to come; and this <I>too</I> after the manner of men,
Lord Yahweh!  <a name="C7V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:20</font></a> What can
David say more to you? for you know your servant, Lord Yahweh.  <a name="C7V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:21</font></a> For your word's sake, and
according to your own heart, have you worked all this greatness, to make
your servant know it.  <a name="C7V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:22</font></a> Therefore you are great, Yahweh
God: for there is none like you, neither is there any God besides you,
according to all that we have heard with our ears.  <a name="C7V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:23</font></a> What one nation in the earth is
like your people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for
a people, and to make him a name, and to do great things for you, and
awesome things for your land, before your people, whom you redeem to you
out of Egypt, <I>from</I> the nations and their gods?  <a name="C7V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:24</font></a> You did establish to yourself
your people Israel to be a people to you forever; and you, Yahweh, became
their God.  <a name="C7V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:25</font></a> Now, Yahweh
God, the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning
his house, confirm you it forever, and do as you have spoken.  <a name="C7V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:26</font></a> Let your name be magnified
forever, saying, Yahweh of Armies is God over Israel; and the house of
your servant David shall be established before you.  <a name="C7V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:27</font></a> For you, Yahweh of Armies, the
God of Israel, have revealed to your servant, saying, I will build you a
house: therefore has your servant found in his heart to pray this prayer
to you.  <a name="C7V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:28</font></a> Now, O Lord
Yahweh, you are God, and your words are truth, and you have promised this
good thing to your servant:  <a name="C7V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:29</font></a> now therefore let it please you
to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before
you; for you, Lord Yahweh, have spoken it: and with your blessing let the
house of your servant be blessed forever.
<p>  <a name="C8V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:1</font></a> After this it happened
that David struck the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took the
bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the Philistines.  <a name="C8V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:2</font></a> He struck Moab, and measured them
with the line, making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two
lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive. The Moabites
became servants to David, and brought tribute.  <a name="C8V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:3</font></a> David struck also Hadadezer the
son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his dominion at the
River.  <a name="C8V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:4</font></a> David took from him
one thousand seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and
David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for one
hundred chariots.  <a name="C8V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:5</font></a> When the
Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck of
the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.  <a name="C8V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:6</font></a> Then David put garrisons in Syria
of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought
tribute. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.  <a name="C8V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:7</font></a> David took the shields of gold
that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
 <a name="C8V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:8</font></a> From Betah and from
Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.
 <a name="C8V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:9</font></a> When Toi king of Hamath
heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer,  <a name="C8V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:10</font></a> then Toi sent Joram his son to
king David, to Greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against
Hadadezer and struck him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. <I>Joram</I>
brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of
brass:  <a name="C8V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:11</font></a> These also did
king David dedicate to Yahweh, with the silver and gold that he dedicated
of all the nations which he subdued;  <a name="C8V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:12</font></a> of Syria, and of Moab, and of the
children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil
of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.  <a name="C8V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:13</font></a> David got him a name when he
returned from smiting the Syrians in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen
thousand men.  <a name="C8V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:14</font></a> He put
garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all the
Edomites became servants to David. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever
he went.  <a name="C8V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:15</font></a> David reigned
over all Israel; and David executed justice and righteousness to all his
people.  <a name="C8V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:16</font></a> Joab the son of
Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
 <a name="C8V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:17</font></a> and Zadok the son of
Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Seraiah was
scribe;  <a name="C8V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:18</font></a> and Benaiah the
son of Jehoiada <I>was over</I> the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and
David's sons were chief ministers.
<p>  <a name="C9V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:1</font></a> David said, Is there
yet any who is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for
Jonathan's sake?  <a name="C9V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:2</font></a> There was
of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him to
David; and the king said to him, Are you Ziba? He said, Your servant is
he.  <a name="C9V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:3</font></a> The king said, Is
there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of
God to him? Ziba said to the king, Jonathan has yet a son, who is lame of
his feet.  <a name="C9V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:4</font></a> The king said to
him, Where is he? Ziba said to the king, Behold, he is in the house of
Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo Debar.  <a name="C9V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:5</font></a> Then king David sent, and fetched
him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo Debar.  <a name="C9V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:6</font></a> Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan,
the son of Saul, came to David, and fell on his face, and did obeisance.
David said, Mephibosheth. He answered, Behold, your servant!  <a name="C9V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:7</font></a> David said to him, &quot;Don't be
afraid of him; for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your
father's sake, and will restore you all the land of Saul your father; and
you shall eat bread at my table continually.&quot;  <a name="C9V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:8</font></a> He did obeisance, and said,
&quot;What is your servant, that you should look on such a dead dog as I
am?&quot;  <a name="C9V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:9</font></a> Then the king
called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, &quot;All that pertained
to Saul and to all his house have I given to your master's son.  <a name="C9V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:10</font></a> You shall till the land for him,
you, and your sons, and your servants; and you shall bring in <I>the
fruits</I>, that your master's son may have bread to eat: but Mephibosheth
your master's son shall eat bread always at my table.&quot; Now Ziba had
fifteen sons and twenty servants.  <a name="C9V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:11</font></a> Then said Ziba to the king,
According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so your shall
servant do. As for Mephibosheth, <I>said the king</I>, he shall eat at my
table, as one of the king's sons.  <a name="C9V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:12</font></a> Mephibosheth had a young son,
whose name was Mica. All that lived in the house of Ziba were servants to
Mephibosheth.  <a name="C9V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:13</font></a> So
Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem; for he ate continually at the king's
table. He was lame in both his feet.
<p>  <a name="C10V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:1</font></a> It happened after
this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son
reigned in his place.  <a name="C10V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:2</font></a> David said, I will show kindness
to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me. So David
sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father. David's
servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.  <a name="C10V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:3</font></a> But the princes of the children
of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, Do you think that David honors your
father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Hasn't David sent his
servants to you to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow
it?  <a name="C10V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:4</font></a> So Hanun took David's
servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their
garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
 <a name="C10V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:5</font></a> When they told it to
David, he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. The king
said, Wait at Jericho until your beards are grown, and then return.
 <a name="C10V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:6</font></a> When the children of
Ammon saw that they were become odious to David, the children of Ammon
sent and hired the Syrians of Beth Rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty
thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with one thousand men, and the
men of Tob twelve thousand men.  <a name="C10V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:7</font></a> When David heard of it, he sent
Joab, and all the army of the mighty men.  <a name="C10V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:8</font></a> The children of Ammon came out,
and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate: and the Syrians
of Zobah and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves
in the field.  <a name="C10V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:9</font></a> Now when
Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose
of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the
Syrians:  <a name="C10V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:10</font></a> The rest of the
people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and he put them
in array against the children of Ammon.  <a name="C10V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:11</font></a> He said, If the Syrians are too
strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the children of Ammon are
too strong for you, then I will come and help you.  <a name="C10V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:12</font></a> Be of good courage, and let us
be strong for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Yahweh do
that which seems him good.  <a name="C10V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:13</font></a> So Joab and the people who were
with him drew near to the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before
him.  <a name="C10V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:14</font></a> When the children
of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai,
and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon,
and came to Jerusalem.  <a name="C10V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:15</font></a> When the Syrians saw that they
were defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together.  <a name="C10V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:16</font></a> Hadadezer sent, and brought out
the Syrians who were beyond the River: and they came to Helam, with
Shobach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head.  <a name="C10V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:17</font></a> It was told David; and he
gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to
Helam. The Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with
him.  <a name="C10V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:18</font></a> The Syrians fled
before Israel; and David killed of the Syrians <I>the men of</I> seven
hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and struck Shobach the
captain of their army, so that he died there.  <a name="C10V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:19</font></a> When all the kings who were
servants to Hadadezer saw that they were defeated before Israel, they made
peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the
children of Ammon any more.
<p> <a name="C11V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:1</font></a> It happened, at the
return of the year, at the time when kings go out <I>to battle</I>, that
David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they
destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at
Jerusalem.  <a name="C11V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:2</font></a> It happened at
evening, that David arose from off his bed, and walked on the roof of the
king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was
very beautiful to look on.  <a name="C11V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:3</font></a> David send and inquired after the
woman. One said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of
Uriah the Hittite?  <a name="C11V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:4</font></a> David
sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her
(for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned to her
house.  <a name="C11V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:5</font></a> The woman
conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, I am with child.  <a name="C11V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:6</font></a> David sent to Joab,
<I>saying</I>, Send me Uriah the Hittite. Joab sent Uriah to David.
 <a name="C11V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:7</font></a> When Uriah was come to
him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how
the war prospered.  <a name="C11V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:8</font></a> David
said to Uriah, Go down to your house, and wash your feet. Uriah departed
out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess <I>of food</I> from
the king.  <a name="C11V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:9</font></a> But Uriah slept
at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and
didn't go down to his house.  <a name="C11V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:10</font></a> When they had told David,
saying, Uriah didn't go down to his house, David said to Uriah, Haven't
you come from a journey? why did you not go down to your house?  <a name="C11V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:11</font></a> Uriah said to David, The ark,
and Israel, and Judah, abide in booths; and my lord Joab, and the servants
of my lord, are encamped in the open field; shall I then go into my house,
to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as you live, and as your
soul lives, I will not do this thing.  <a name="C11V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:12</font></a> David said to Uriah, Stay here
today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart. So Uriah abode in
Jerusalem that day, and the next day.  <a name="C11V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:13</font></a> When David had called him, he
ate and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out
to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but didn't go down to his
house.  <a name="C11V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:14</font></a> It happened in
the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of
Uriah.  <a name="C11V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:15</font></a> He wrote in the
letter, saying, Set Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and
retire you from him, that he may be struck, and die.  <a name="C11V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:16</font></a> It happened, when Joab kept
watch on the city, that he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that
valiant men were.  <a name="C11V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:17</font></a> The
men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the
people, even of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.
 <a name="C11V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:18</font></a> Then Joab sent and told
David all the things concerning the war;  <a name="C11V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:19</font></a> and he commanded the messenger,
saying, &quot;When you have made an end of telling all the things
concerning the war to the king,  <a name="C11V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:20</font></a> it shall be that, if the king's
wrath arise, and he tells you, 'Why did you go so near to the city to
fight? Didn't you know that they would shoot from the wall?  <a name="C11V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:21</font></a> who struck Abimelech the son of
Jerubbesheth? Didn't a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall,
so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?' then you
shall say, 'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:22</font></a> So the messenger
went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.  <a name="C11V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:23</font></a> The messenger said to David, The
men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were
on them even to the entrance of the gate.  <a name="C11V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:24</font></a> The shooters shot at your
servants from off the wall; and some of the king's servants are dead, and
your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.  <a name="C11V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:25</font></a> Then David said to the
messenger, Thus you shall tell Joab, Don't let this thing displease you,
for the sword devours one as well as another; make your battle more strong
against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage you him.  <a name="C11V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:26</font></a> When the wife of Uriah heard
that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband.
 <a name="C11V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:27</font></a> When the mourning was
past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife,
and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased Yahweh.
<p> <a name="C12V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:1</font></a> Yahweh sent Nathan to
David. He came to him, and said to him, &quot;There were two men in one
city; the one rich, and the other poor.  <a name="C12V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:2</font></a> The rich man had very many flocks
and herds,  <a name="C12V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:3</font></a> but the poor
man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and
raised. It grew up together with him, and with his children. It ate of his
own food, drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him like
a daughter.  <a name="C12V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:4</font></a> A traveler
came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his
own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man who had come to him, but took the
poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man who had come to him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:5</font></a> David's anger was
greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan, &quot;As Yahweh
lives, the man who has done this is worthy to die!  <a name="C12V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:6</font></a> He shall restore the lamb
fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity!&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:7</font></a> Nathan said to David,
&quot;You are the man. This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: 'I
anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of
Saul.  <a name="C12V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:8</font></a> I gave you your
master's house, and your master's wives into your bosom, and gave you the
house of Israel and of Judah; and if that would have been too little, I
would have added to you many more such things.  <a name="C12V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:9</font></a> Why have you despised the word of
Yahweh, to do that which is evil in his sight? You have struck Uriah the
Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have
slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.  <a name="C12V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:10</font></a> Now therefore the sword will
never depart from your house, because you have despised me, and have taken
the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.'  <a name="C12V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:11</font></a> This is what Yahweh says:
'Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house; and I
will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and
he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.  <a name="C12V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:12</font></a> For you did it secretly, but I
will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:13</font></a> David said to Nathan,
&quot;I have sinned against Yahweh.&quot;
<p>Nathan said to David, &quot;Yahweh also has put away your sin. You will
not die.  <a name="C12V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:14</font></a> However,
because by this deed you have given great occasion to Yahweh's enemies to
blaspheme, the child also who is born to you shall surely die.&quot;
 <a name="C12V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:15</font></a> Nathan departed to his
house.
<p>Yahweh struck the child that Uriah's wife bore to David, and it was
very sick.  <a name="C12V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:16</font></a> David
therefore begged God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay
all night on the earth.  <a name="C12V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:17</font></a> The elders of his house arose,
<I>and stood</I> beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would
not, neither did he eat bread with them.  <a name="C12V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:18</font></a> It happened on the seventh day,
that the child died. The servants of David feared to tell him that the
child was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we
spoke to him, and he didn't listen to our voice: how will he then harm
himself, if we tell him that the child is dead!  <a name="C12V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:19</font></a> But when David saw that his
servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was
dead; and David said to his servants, Is the child dead? They said, He is
dead.  <a name="C12V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:20</font></a> Then David arose
from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his
clothing; and he came into the house of Yahweh, and worshiped: then he
came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him,
and he ate.  <a name="C12V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:21</font></a> Then said
his servants to him, What thing is this that you have done? you did fast
and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead,
you did rise and eat bread.  <a name="C12V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:22</font></a> He said, While the child was yet
alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who knows whether Yahweh will not be
gracious to me, that the child may live?  <a name="C12V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:23</font></a> But now he is dead, why should I
fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not
return to me.  <a name="C12V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:24</font></a> David
comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her: and
she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. Yahweh loved him;  <a name="C12V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:25</font></a> and he sent by the hand of
Nathan the prophet; and he named him Jedidiah, for Yahweh's sake.  <a name="C12V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:26</font></a> Now Joab fought against Rabbah
of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.  <a name="C12V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:27</font></a> Joab sent messengers to David,
and said, I have fought against Rabbah; yes, I have taken the city of
waters.  <a name="C12V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:28</font></a> Now therefore
gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and
take it; lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.  <a name="C12V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:29</font></a> David gathered all the people
together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.  <a name="C12V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:30</font></a> He took the crown of their king
from off his head; and its weight was a talent of gold, and <I>in it
were</I> precious stones; and it was set on David's head. He brought forth
the spoil of the city, exceeding much.  <a name="C12V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:31</font></a> He brought forth the people who
were therein, and put them under saws, and under iron picks, and under
axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick kiln: and he did so to
all the cities of the children of Ammon. David and all the people returned
to Jerusalem.
<p> <a name="C13V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:1</font></a> It happened after
this, that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister, whose name was
Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.  <a name="C13V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:2</font></a> Amnon was so troubled that he
fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed
hard to Amnon to do anything to her.  <a name="C13V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:3</font></a> But Amnon had a friend, whose
name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother; and Jonadab was a
very subtle man.  <a name="C13V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:4</font></a> He said
to him, Why, son of the king, are you thus lean from day to day? Won't you
tell me? Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.
 <a name="C13V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:5</font></a> Jonadab said to him, Lay
you down on your bed, and feign yourself sick: and when your father comes
to see you, tell him, Please let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to
eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from
her hand.  <a name="C13V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:6</font></a> So Amnon lay
down, and feigned himself sick: and when the king was come to see him,
Amnon said to the king, Please let her sister Tamar come, and make me a
couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.  <a name="C13V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:7</font></a> Then David sent home to Tamar,
saying, Go now to your brother Amnon's house, and dress him food.  <a name="C13V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:8</font></a> So Tamar went to her brother
Amnon's house; and he was laid down. She took dough, and kneaded it, and
made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.  <a name="C13V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:9</font></a> She took the pan, and poured them
out before him; but he refused to eat. Amnon said, Have out all men from
me. They went out every man from him.  <a name="C13V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:10</font></a> Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the
food into the chamber, that I may eat from your hand. Tamar took the cakes
which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her
brother.  <a name="C13V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:11</font></a> When she had
brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her,
Come, lie with me, my sister.  <a name="C13V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:12</font></a> She answered him, No, my
brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel.
Don't you do this folly.  <a name="C13V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:13</font></a> I, where shall I carry my shame?
and as for you, you will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore,
please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.  <a name="C13V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:14</font></a> However he would not listen to
her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.
 <a name="C13V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:15</font></a> Then Amnon hated her
with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was
greater than the love with which he had loved her. Amnon said to her,
Arise, be gone.  <a name="C13V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:16</font></a> She said
to him, Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is
<I>worse</I> than the other that you did to me. But he would not listen to
her.  <a name="C13V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:17</font></a> Then he called his
servant who ministered to him, and said, Put now this woman out from me,
and bolt the door after her.  <a name="C13V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:18</font></a> She had a garment of various
colors on her; for with such robes were the king's daughters who were
virgins dressed. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door
after her.  <a name="C13V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:19</font></a> Tamar put
ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various colors that was on her;
and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she
went.  <a name="C13V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:20</font></a> Absalom her
brother said to her, Has Amnon your brother been with you? but now hold
your peace, my sister: he is your brother; don't take this thing to heart.
So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.  <a name="C13V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:21</font></a> But when king David heard of all
these things, he was very angry.  <a name="C13V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:22</font></a> Absalom spoke to Amnon neither
good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister
Tamar.  <a name="C13V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:23</font></a> It happened after
two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal Hazor, which is
beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons.  <a name="C13V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:24</font></a> Absalom came to the king, and
said, See now, your servant has sheepshearers; let the king, I pray you,
and his servants go with your servant.  <a name="C13V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:25</font></a> The king said to Absalom, No, my
son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you. He pressed him:
however he would not go, but blessed him.  <a name="C13V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:26</font></a> Then said Absalom, If not,
please let my brother Amnon go with us. The king said to him, Why should
he go with you?  <a name="C13V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:27</font></a> But
Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
 <a name="C13V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:28</font></a> Absalom commanded his
servants, saying, Mark you now, when Amnon's heart is merry with wine; and
when I tell you, Smite Amnon, then kill him; don't be afraid; haven't I
commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.  <a name="C13V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:29</font></a> The servants of Absalom did to
Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every
man got him up on his mule, and fled.  <a name="C13V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:30</font></a> It happened, while they were in
the way, that the news came to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the
king's sons, and there is not one of them left.  <a name="C13V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:31</font></a> Then the king arose, and tore
his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with
their clothes torn.  <a name="C13V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:32</font></a> Jonadab, the son of Shimeah,
David's brother, answered, Don't let my lord suppose that they have killed
all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the
appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he
forced his sister Tamar.  <a name="C13V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:33</font></a> Now therefore don't let my lord
the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons
are dead; for Amnon only is dead.  <a name="C13V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:34</font></a> But Absalom fled. The young man
who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people
were coming by way of the hillside behind him.  <a name="C13V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:35</font></a> Jonadab said to the king,
Behold, the king's sons are come: as your servant said, so it is.  <a name="C13V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:36</font></a> It happened, as soon as he had
made an end of speaking, that behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up
their voice, and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very
sore.  <a name="C13V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:37</font></a> But Absalom fled,
and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. <I>David</I>
mourned for his son every day.  <a name="C13V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:38</font></a> So Absalom fled, and went to
Geshur, and was there three years.  <a name="C13V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:39</font></a> <I>the soul of</I> king David
longed to go forth to Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon,
seeing he was dead.
<p> <a name="C14V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:1</font></a> Now Joab the son of
Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.  <a name="C14V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:2</font></a> Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched
there a wise woman, and said to her, please act like a mourner, and put on
mourning clothing, Please, and don't anoint yourself with oil, but be as a
woman who has a long time mourned for the dead:  <a name="C14V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:3</font></a> and go in to the king, and speak
on this manner to him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.  <a name="C14V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:4</font></a> When the woman of Tekoa spoke to
the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said,
Help, O king.  <a name="C14V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:5</font></a> The king
said to her, What ails you? She answered, Of a truth I am a widow, and my
husband is dead.  <a name="C14V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:6</font></a> Your
handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and
there was none to part them, but the one struck the other, and killed him.
 <a name="C14V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:7</font></a> Behold, the whole family
is risen against your handmaid, and they say, Deliver him who struck his
brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he killed,
and so destroy the heir also. Thus will they quench my coal which is left,
and will leave to my husband neither name nor remainder on the surface of
the earth.  <a name="C14V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:8</font></a> The king said
to the woman, Go to your house, and I will give a command concerning you.
 <a name="C14V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:9</font></a> The woman of Tekoa said
to the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's
house; and the king and his throne be guiltless.  <a name="C14V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:10</font></a> The king said, Whoever says
anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall not touch you any more.
 <a name="C14V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:11</font></a> Then said she, Please
let the king remember Yahweh your God, that the avenger of blood destroy
not any more, lest they destroy my son. He said, As Yahweh lives, there
shall not one hair of your son fall to the earth.  <a name="C14V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:12</font></a> Then the woman said, Please let
your handmaid speak a word to my lord the king. He said, Say on.  <a name="C14V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:13</font></a> The woman said, Why then have
you devised such a thing against the people of God? for in speaking this
word the king is as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring
home again his banished one.  <a name="C14V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:14</font></a> For we must needs die, and are
as water split on the ground, which can't be gathered up again; neither
does God take away life, but devises means, that he who is banished not be
an outcast from him.  <a name="C14V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:15</font></a> Now
therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my lord the king,
it is because the people have made me afraid: and your handmaid said, I
will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the
request of his servant.  <a name="C14V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:16</font></a> For the king will hear, to
deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my
son together out of the inheritance of God.  <a name="C14V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:17</font></a> Then your handmaid said, Please
let the word of my lord the king be comfortable; for as an angel of God,
so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: and Yahweh your God be
with you.  <a name="C14V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:18</font></a> Then the king
answered the woman, Please don't hide anything from me that I shall ask
you. The woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.  <a name="C14V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:19</font></a> The king said, Is the hand of
Joab with you in all this? The woman answered, As your soul lives, my lord
the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything
that my lord the king has spoken; for your servant Joab, he bade me, and
he put all these words in the mouth of your handmaid;  <a name="C14V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:20</font></a> to change the face of the matter
has your servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to
the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.
 <a name="C14V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:21</font></a> The king said to Joab,
Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man
Absalom back.  <a name="C14V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:22</font></a> Joab fell
to the ground on his face, and did obeisance, and blessed the king: and
Joab said, Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight,
my lord, king, in that the king has performed the request of his servant.
 <a name="C14V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:23</font></a> So Joab arose and went
to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.  <a name="C14V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:24</font></a> The king said, Let him turn to
his own house, but let him not see my face. So Absalom turned to his own
house, and didn't see the king's face.  <a name="C14V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:25</font></a> Now in all Israel there was none
to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot
even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.  <a name="C14V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:26</font></a> When he cut the hair of his head
(now it was at every year's end that he cut it; because it was heavy on
him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred
shekels, after the king's weight.  <a name="C14V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:27</font></a> To Absalom there were born three
sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a
beautiful face.  <a name="C14V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:28</font></a> Absalom
lived two full years in Jerusalem; and he didn't see the king's face.
 <a name="C14V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:29</font></a> Then Absalom sent for
Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and he sent
again a second time, but he would not come.  <a name="C14V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:30</font></a> Therefore he said to his
servants, Behold, Joab's field is near mine, and he has barley there; go
and set it on fire. Absalom's servants set the field on fire.  <a name="C14V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:31</font></a> Then Joab arose, and came to
Absalom to his house, and said to him, Why have your servants set my field
on fire?  <a name="C14V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:32</font></a> Absalom
answered Joab, Behold, I sent to you, saying, Come here, that I may send
you to the king, to say, Why am I come from Geshur? it were better for me
to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there
be iniquity in me, let him kill me.  <a name="C14V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:33</font></a> So Joab came to the king, and
told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and
bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king
kissed Absalom.
<p> <a name="C15V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:1</font></a> It happened after
this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run
before him.  <a name="C15V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:2</font></a> Absalom rose
up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when
any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then
Absalom called to him, and said, Of what city are you? He said, Your
servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.  <a name="C15V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:3</font></a> Absalom said to him, Behold, your
matters are good and right; but there is no man deputized of the king to
hear you.  <a name="C15V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:4</font></a> Absalom said
moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who has
any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!  <a name="C15V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:5</font></a> It was so, that when any man came
near to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and
kissed him.  <a name="C15V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:6</font></a> In this
manner Absalom did to all Israel who came to the king for judgment: so
Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.  <a name="C15V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:7</font></a> It happened at the end of forty
years, that Absalom said to the king, please let me go and pay my vow,
which I have vowed to Yahweh, in Hebron.  <a name="C15V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:8</font></a> For your servant vowed a vow
while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If Yahweh shall indeed bring me
again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Yahweh.  <a name="C15V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:9</font></a> The king said to him, Go in
peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.  <a name="C15V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:10</font></a> But Absalom sent spies
throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as you hear the sound
of the trumpet, then you shall say, Absalom is king in Hebron.  <a name="C15V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:11</font></a> With Absalom went two hundred
men out of Jerusalem, who were invited, and went in their simplicity; and
they didn't know anything.  <a name="C15V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:12</font></a> Absalom sent for Ahithophel the
Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was
offering the sacrifices. The conspiracy was strong; for the people
increased continually with Absalom.  <a name="C15V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:13</font></a> There came a messenger to David,
saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.  <a name="C15V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:14</font></a> David said to all his servants
who were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for else none of
us shall escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us
quickly, and bring down evil on us, and strike the city with the edge of
the sword.  <a name="C15V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:15</font></a> The king's
servants said to the king, Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever
my lord the king shall choose.  <a name="C15V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:16</font></a> The king went forth, and all his
household after him. The king left ten women, who were concubines, to keep
the house.  <a name="C15V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:17</font></a> The king went
forth, and all the people after him; and they stayed in Beth Merhak.
 <a name="C15V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:18</font></a> All his servants passed
on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all
the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on
before the king.  <a name="C15V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:19</font></a> Then
said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Why go you also with us? return, and
abide with the king: for you are a foreigner, and also an exile;
<I>return</I> to your own place.  <a name="C15V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:20</font></a> Whereas you came but yesterday,
should I this day make you go up and down with us, seeing I go where I
may? return you, and take back your brothers; mercy and truth be with you.
 <a name="C15V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:21</font></a> Ittai answered the king,
and said, As Yahweh lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in what
place my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, even there
also will your servant be.  <a name="C15V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:22</font></a> David said to Ittai, Go and pass
over. Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little
ones who were with him.  <a name="C15V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:23</font></a> All the country wept with a loud
voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over
the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the
wilderness.  <a name="C15V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:24</font></a> Behold,
Zadok also <I>came</I>, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of
the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went
up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.  <a name="C15V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:25</font></a> The king said to Zadok, Carry
back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of
Yahweh, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:
 <a name="C15V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:26</font></a> but if he say thus, I
have no delight in you; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seems good
to him.  <a name="C15V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:27</font></a> The king said
also to Zadok the priest, &quot;Aren't you a seer? Return into the city in
peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son
of Abiathar.  <a name="C15V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:28</font></a> Behold, I
will stay at the fords of the wilderness, until word comes from you to
inform me.&quot;  <a name="C15V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:29</font></a> Zadok
therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they
abode there.  <a name="C15V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:30</font></a> David went
up by the ascent of the <I>Mount of</I> Olives, and wept as he went up;
and he had his head covered, and went barefoot: and all the people who
were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as
they went up.  <a name="C15V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:31</font></a> One told
David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. David
said, Yahweh, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.
 <a name="C15V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:32</font></a> It happened that when
David had come to the top <I>of the ascent</I>, where God was worshiped,
behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn, and earth
on his head.  <a name="C15V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:33</font></a> David said
to him, If you pass on with me, then you will be a burden to me:  <a name="C15V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:34</font></a> but if you return to the city,
and tell Absalom, I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your
father's servant in time past, so will I now be your servant; then will
you defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.  <a name="C15V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:35</font></a> Don't you have Zadok and
Abiathar the priests there with you? therefore it shall be, that whatever
thing you shall hear out of the king's house, you shall tell it to Zadok
and Abiathar the priests.  <a name="C15V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:36</font></a> Behold, they have there with
them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son;
and by them you shall send to me everything that you shall hear.  <a name="C15V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:37</font></a> So Hushai, David's friend, came
into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem.
<p> <a name="C16V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:1</font></a> When David was a
little past the top <I>of the ascent</I>, behold, Ziba the servant of
Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of donkeys saddled, and on them two
hundred loaves of bread, and one hundred clusters of raisins, and one
hundred summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.  <a name="C16V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:2</font></a> The king said to Ziba, What do
you mean by these? Ziba said, The donkeys are for the king's household to
ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the
wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.  <a name="C16V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:3</font></a> The king said, Where is your
master's son? Ziba said to the king, Behold, he abides at Jerusalem; for
he said, Today will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my
father.  <a name="C16V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:4</font></a> Then said the
king to Ziba, Behold, all that pertains to Mephibosheth is yours. Ziba
said, I do obeisance; let me find favor in your sight, my lord, O king.
 <a name="C16V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:5</font></a> When king David came to
Bahurim, behold, a man of the family of the house of Saul came out, whose
name was Shimei, the son of Gera. He came out, and cursed still as he
came.  <a name="C16V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:6</font></a> He cast stones at
David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all
the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.  <a name="C16V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:7</font></a> Thus said Shimei when he cursed,
Be gone, be gone, you man of blood, and base fellow:  <a name="C16V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:8</font></a> Yahweh has returned on you all
the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and
Yahweh has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son; and
behold, you are <I>taken</I> in your own mischief, because you are a man
of blood.  <a name="C16V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:9</font></a> Then said
Abishai the son of Zeruiah to the king, &quot;Why should this dead dog
curse my lord the king? Please let me go over and take off his head.&quot;
 <a name="C16V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:10</font></a> The king said, What have
I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Because he curses, and because
Yahweh has said to him, Curse David; who then shall say, Why have you done
so?  <a name="C16V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:11</font></a> David said to
Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my
bowels, seeks my life: how much more <I>may</I> this Benjamite now <I>do
it</I>? let him alone, and let him curse; for Yahweh has invited him.
 <a name="C16V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:12</font></a> It may be that Yahweh
will look on the wrong done to me, and that Yahweh will requite me good
for <I>his</I> cursing of me this day.  <a name="C16V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:13</font></a> So David and his men went by the
way; and Shimei went along on the hillside over against him, and cursed as
he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.  <a name="C16V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:14</font></a> The king, and all the people who
were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.  <a name="C16V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:15</font></a> Absalom, and all the people, the
men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.  <a name="C16V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:16</font></a> It happened, when Hushai the
Archite, David's friend, was come to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom,
<I>Long</I> live the king, <I>Long</I> live the king.  <a name="C16V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:17</font></a> Absalom said to Hushai, Is this
your kindness to your friend? Why didn't you go with your friend?  <a name="C16V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:18</font></a> Hushai said to Absalom, No; but
whom Yahweh, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his
will I be, and with him will I abide.  <a name="C16V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:19</font></a> Again, whom should I serve?
Shouldn't I serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in your
father's presence, so will I be in your presence.  <a name="C16V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:20</font></a> Then said Absalom to Ahithophel,
Give your counsel what we shall do.  <a name="C16V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:21</font></a> Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go
in to your father's concubines, that he has left to keep the house; and
all Israel will hear that you are abhorred of your father: then will the
hands of all who are with you be strong.  <a name="C16V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:22</font></a> So they spread Absalom a tent on
the top of the house; and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in
the sight of all Israel.  <a name="C16V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:23</font></a> The counsel of Ahithophel, which
he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so
was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
<p> <a name="C17V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:1</font></a> Moreover Ahithophel
said to Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will
arise and pursue after David this night:  <a name="C17V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:2</font></a> and I will come on him while he
is weary and exhausted, and will make him afraid; and all the people who
are with him shall flee; and I will strike the king only;  <a name="C17V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:3</font></a> and I will bring back all the
people to you: the man whom you seek is as if all returned: <I>so</I> all
the people shall be in peace.  <a name="C17V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:4</font></a> The saying pleased Absalom well,
and all the elders of Israel.  <a name="C17V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:5</font></a> Then said Absalom, Call now
Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he says.  <a name="C17V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:6</font></a> When Hushai was come to Absalom,
Absalom spoke to him, saying, Ahithophel has spoken after this manner:
shall we do <I>after</I> his saying? if not, speak up.  <a name="C17V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:7</font></a> Hushai said to Absalom, The
counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good.  <a name="C17V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:8</font></a> Hushai said moreover, You know
your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are fierce in
their minds, as a bear robbed of her cubs in the field; and your father is
a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.  <a name="C17V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:9</font></a> Behold, he is hid now in some
pit, or in some <I>other</I> place: and it will happen, when some of them
are fallen at the first, that whoever hears it will say, There is a
slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.  <a name="C17V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:10</font></a> Even he who is valiant, whose
heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knows
that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant
men.  <a name="C17V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:11</font></a> But I counsel that
all Israel be gathered together to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the
sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in your
own person.  <a name="C17V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:12</font></a> So shall we
come on him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light on
him as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and of all the men who are
with him we will not leave so much as one.  <a name="C17V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:13</font></a> Moreover, if he be gotten into a
city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it
into the river, until there not be one small stone found there.  <a name="C17V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:14</font></a> Absalom and all the men of
Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel
of Ahithophel. For Yahweh had ordained to defeat the good counsel of
Ahithophel, to the intent that Yahweh might bring evil on Absalom.  <a name="C17V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:15</font></a> Then Hushai said to Zadok and to
Abiathar the priests, Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of
Israel that way; and I have counseled this way.  <a name="C17V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:16</font></a> Now therefore send quickly, and
tell David, saying, Don't lodge this night at the fords of the wilderness,
but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the
people who are with him.  <a name="C17V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:17</font></a> Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were
staying by En Rogel; and a female servant used to go and tell them; and
they went and told king David: for they might not be seen to come into the
city.  <a name="C17V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:18</font></a> But a boy saw
them, and told Absalom: and they went both of them away quickly, and came
to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they
went down there.  <a name="C17V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:19</font></a> The
woman took and spread the covering over the well's mouth, and strewed
bruised grain thereon; and nothing was known.  <a name="C17V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:20</font></a> Absalom's servants came to the
woman to the house; and they said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? The
woman said to them, They have gone over the brook of water. When they had
sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.  <a name="C17V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:21</font></a> It happened, after they had
departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David;
and they said to David, Arise you, and pass quickly over the water; for
thus has Ahithophel counseled against you.  <a name="C17V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:22</font></a> Then David arose, and all the
people who were with him, and they passed over the Jordan: by the morning
light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan.
 <a name="C17V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:23</font></a> When Ahithophel saw that
his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, and arose, and got
him home, to his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and
he died, and was buried in the tomb of his father.  <a name="C17V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:24</font></a> Then David came to Mahanaim.
Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
 <a name="C17V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:25</font></a> Absalom set Amasa over
the army instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was
Ithra the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister
to Zeruiah, Joab's mother.  <a name="C17V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:26</font></a> Israel and Absalom encamped in
the land of Gilead.  <a name="C17V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:27</font></a> It
happened, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of
Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar,
and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,  <a name="C17V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:28</font></a> brought beds, and basins, and
earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched
<I>grain</I>, and beans, and lentils, and parched <I>pulse</I>,  <a name="C17V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:29</font></a> and honey, and butter, and
sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people who were with
him, to eat: for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty,
in the wilderness.
<p> <a name="C18V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:1</font></a> David numbered the
people who were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of
hundreds over them.  <a name="C18V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:2</font></a> David
sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third
part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a
third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the
people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.  <a name="C18V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:3</font></a> But the people said, You shall
not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if
half of us die, will they care for us: but you are worth ten thousand of
us; therefore now it is better that you are ready to help us out of the
city.  <a name="C18V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:4</font></a> The king said to
them, What seems you best I will do. The king stood beside the gate, and
all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.  <a name="C18V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:5</font></a> The king commanded Joab and
Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man,
even with Absalom. All the people heard when the king commanded all the
captains concerning Absalom.  <a name="C18V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:6</font></a> So the people went out into the
field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.  <a name="C18V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:7</font></a> The people of Israel were struck
there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there
that day of twenty thousand men.  <a name="C18V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:8</font></a> For the battle was there spread
over the surface of all the country; and the forest devoured more people
that day than the sword devoured.  <a name="C18V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:9</font></a> Absalom happened to meet the
servants of David. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under
the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and
he was taken up between the sky and earth; and the mule that was under him
went on.  <a name="C18V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:10</font></a> A certain man
saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.
 <a name="C18V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:11</font></a> Joab said to the man who
told him, Behold, you saw it, and why didn't you strike him there to the
ground? and I would have given you ten <I>pieces of</I> silver, and a
sash.  <a name="C18V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:12</font></a> The man said to
Joab, Though I should receive a thousand <I>pieces of</I> silver in my
hand, I still wouldn't put forth my hand against the king's son; for in
our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware
that none touch the young man Absalom.  <a name="C18V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:13</font></a> Otherwise if I had dealt falsely
against his life (and there is no matter hid from the king), then you
yourself would have set yourself against <I>me</I>.  <a name="C18V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:14</font></a> Then said Joab, I may not wait
thus with you. He took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through
the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.
 <a name="C18V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:15</font></a> Ten young men who bore
Joab's armor surrounded and struck Absalom, and killed him.  <a name="C18V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:16</font></a> Joab blew the trumpet, and the
people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the people.
 <a name="C18V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:17</font></a> They took Absalom, and
cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very
great heap of stones: and all Israel fled everyone to his tent.  <a name="C18V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:18</font></a> Now Absalom in his lifetime had
taken and reared up for himself the pillar, which is in the king's dale;
for he said, I have no son to keep my name in memory: and he called the
pillar after his own name; and it is called Absalom's monument, to this
day.  <a name="C18V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:19</font></a> Then said Ahimaaz
the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king news, how that Yahweh
has avenged him of his enemies.  <a name="C18V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:20</font></a> Joab said to him, You shall not
be the bearer of news this day, but you shall bear news another day; but
this day you shall bear no news, because the king's son is dead.  <a name="C18V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:21</font></a> Then said Joab to the Cushite,
Go, tell the king what you have seen. The Cushite bowed himself to Joab,
and ran.  <a name="C18V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:22</font></a> Then said
Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But come what may, Please let
me also run after the Cushite. Joab said, Why will you run, my son, seeing
that you will have no reward for the news?  <a name="C18V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:23</font></a> But come what may, <I>said
he</I>, I will run. He said to him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of
the Plain, and outran the Cushite.  <a name="C18V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:24</font></a> Now David was sitting between
the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the
wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running
alone.  <a name="C18V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:25</font></a> The watchman
cried, and told the king. The king said, If he be alone, there is news in
his mouth. He came apace, and drew near.  <a name="C18V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:26</font></a> The watchman saw another man
running; and the watchman called to the porter, and said, Behold,
<I>another</I> man running alone. The king said, He also brings news.
 <a name="C18V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:27</font></a> The watchman said, I
think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son
of Zadok. The king said, He is a good man, and comes with good news.
 <a name="C18V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:28</font></a> Ahimaaz called, and said
to the king, All is well. He bowed himself before the king with his face
to the earth, and said, Blessed be Yahweh your God, who has delivered up
the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king.  <a name="C18V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:29</font></a> The king said, Is it well with
the young man Absalom? Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's
servant, even me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I don't know what
it was.  <a name="C18V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:30</font></a> The king said,
Turn aside, and stand here. He turned aside, and stood still.  <a name="C18V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:31</font></a> Behold, the Cushite came; and
the Cushite said, News for my lord the king; for Yahweh has avenged you
this day of all those who rose up against you.  <a name="C18V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:32</font></a> The king said to the Cushite, Is
it well with the young man Absalom? The Cushite answered, The enemies of
my lord the king, and all who rise up against you to do you hurt, be as
that young man is.  <a name="C18V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:33</font></a> The
king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept:
and as he went, thus he said, my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom!
would I had died for you, Absalom, my son, my son!
<p> <a name="C19V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:1</font></a> It was told Joab,
Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.  <a name="C19V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:2</font></a> The victory that day was turned
into mourning to all the people; for the people heard say that day, The
king grieves for his son.  <a name="C19V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:3</font></a> The people got them by stealth
that day into the city, as people who are ashamed steal away when they
flee in battle.  <a name="C19V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:4</font></a> The king
covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, my son Absalom,
Absalom, my son, my son!  <a name="C19V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:5</font></a> Joab came into the house to the
king, and said, You have shamed this day the faces of all your servants,
who this day have saved your life, and the lives of your sons and of your
daughters, and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines;
 <a name="C19V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:6</font></a> in that you love those
who hate you, and hate those who love you. For you have declared this day,
that princes and servants are nothing to you: for this day I perceive that
if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased
you well.  <a name="C19V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:7</font></a> Now therefore
arise, go forth, and speak comfortably to your servants; for I swear by
Yahweh, if you don't go forth, there will not stay a man with you this
night: and that will be worse to you than all the evil that has happened
to you from your youth until now.  <a name="C19V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:8</font></a> Then the king arose, and sat in
the gate. They told to all the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting
in the gate: and all the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled
every man to his tent.  <a name="C19V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:9</font></a> All the people were at strife
throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of
the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the
Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land from Absalom.  <a name="C19V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:10</font></a> Absalom, whom we anointed over
us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why don't you speak a word of
bringing the king back?  <a name="C19V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:11</font></a> King David sent to Zadok and to
Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why
are you the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of
all Israel is come to the king, <I>to bring him</I> to his house.  <a name="C19V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:12</font></a> You are my brothers, you are my
bone and my flesh: why then are you the last to bring back the king?
 <a name="C19V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:13</font></a> Say you to Amasa, Aren't
you my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if you aren't
captain of the army before me continually in the room of Joab.  <a name="C19V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:14</font></a> He bowed the heart of all the
men of Judah, even as <I>the heart of</I> one man; so that they sent to
the king, <I>saying</I>, Return you, and all your servants.  <a name="C19V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:15</font></a> So the king returned, and came
to the Jordan. Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the
king over the Jordan.  <a name="C19V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:16</font></a> Shimei the son of Gera, the
Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah
to meet king David.  <a name="C19V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:17</font></a> There were a thousand men of
Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his
fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went through the
Jordan in the presence of the king.  <a name="C19V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:18</font></a> A ferry boat went to bring over
the king's household, and to do what he thought good. Shimei the son of
Gera fell down before the king, when he was come over the Jordan.  <a name="C19V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:19</font></a> He said to the king, Don't let
my lord impute iniquity to me, neither do you remember that which your
servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of
Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.  <a name="C19V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:20</font></a> For your servant does know that
I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come this day the first of all the
house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.  <a name="C19V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:21</font></a> But Abishai the son of Zeruiah
answered, Shall Shimei not be put to death for this, because he cursed
Yahweh's anointed?  <a name="C19V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:22</font></a> David
said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should
this day be adversaries to me? shall there any man be put to death this
day in Israel? for don't I know that I am this day king over Israel?
 <a name="C19V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:23</font></a> The king said to Shimei,
You shall not die. The king swore to him.  <a name="C19V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:24</font></a> Mephibosheth the son of Saul
came down to meet the king; and he had neither dressed his feet, nor
trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed
until the day he came home in peace.  <a name="C19V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:25</font></a> It happened, when he was come to
Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, Why didn't you go
with me, Mephibosheth?  <a name="C19V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:26</font></a> He answered, My lord, O king, my
servant deceived me: for your servant said, I will saddle me a donkey,
that I may ride thereon, and go with the king; because your servant is
lame.  <a name="C19V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:27</font></a> He has slandered
your servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of
God: do therefore what is good in your eyes.  <a name="C19V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:28</font></a> For all my father's house were
but dead men before my lord the king; yet you set your servant among those
who ate at your own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should
cry any more to the king?  <a name="C19V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:29</font></a> The king said to him, Why speak
you any more of your matters? I say, You and Ziba divide the land.  <a name="C19V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:30</font></a> Mephibosheth said to the king,
yes, let him take all, because my lord the king is come in peace to his
own house.  <a name="C19V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:31</font></a> Barzillai the
Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went over the Jordan with the
king, to conduct him over the Jordan.  <a name="C19V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:32</font></a> Now Barzillai was a very aged
man, even eighty years old: and he had provided the king with sustenance
while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.  <a name="C19V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:33</font></a> The king said to Barzillai, Come
you over with me, and I will sustain you with me in Jerusalem.  <a name="C19V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:34</font></a> Barzillai said to the king, How
many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the
king to Jerusalem?  <a name="C19V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:35</font></a> I am
this day eighty years old: can I discern between good and bad? can your
servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of
singing men and singing women? why then should your servant be yet a
burden to my lord the king?  <a name="C19V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:36</font></a> Your servant would but just go
over the Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me
with such a reward?  <a name="C19V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:37</font></a> Please let your servant turn
back again, that I may die in my own city, by the grave of my father and
my mother. But behold, your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord
the king; and do to him what shall seem good to you.  <a name="C19V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:38</font></a> The king answered, Chimham shall
go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good to you:
and whatever you shall require of me, that will I do for you.  <a name="C19V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:39</font></a> All the people went over the
Jordan, and the king went over: and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed
him; and he returned to his own place.  <a name="C19V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:40</font></a> So the king went over to Gilgal,
and Chimham went over with him: and all the people of Judah brought the
king over, and also half the people of Israel.  <a name="C19V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:41</font></a> Behold, all the men of Israel
came to the king, and said to the king, Why have our brothers the men of
Judah stolen you away, and brought the king, and his household, over the
Jordan, and all David's men with him?  <a name="C19V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:42</font></a> All the men of Judah answered
the men of Israel, Because the king is a close relative to us: why then
are you angry for this matter? have we eaten at all at the king's cost? or
has he given us any gift?  <a name="C19V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:43</font></a> The men of Israel answered the
men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also
more <I>right</I> in David than you: why then did you despise us, that our
advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? The words of the
men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.
<p> <a name="C20V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:1</font></a> There happened to be
there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite:
and he blew the trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither
have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, Israel.
 <a name="C20V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:2</font></a> So all the men of Israel
went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but
the men of Judah joined with their king, from the Jordan even to
Jerusalem.  <a name="C20V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:3</font></a> David came to
his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines,
whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in custody, and provided
them with sustenance, but didn't go in to them. So they were shut up to
the day of their death, living in widowhood.  <a name="C20V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:4</font></a> Then said the king to Amasa, Call
me the men of Judah together within three days, and be here present.
 <a name="C20V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:5</font></a> So Amasa went to call
<I>the men of</I> Judah together; but he stayed longer than the set time
which he had appointed him.  <a name="C20V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:6</font></a> David said to Abishai, Now will
Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take your lord's
servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities, and
escape out of our sight.  <a name="C20V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:7</font></a> There went out after him Joab's
men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and
they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
 <a name="C20V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:8</font></a> When they were at the
great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was girded
with his apparel of war that he had put on, and thereon was a sash with a
sword fastened on his waist in its sheath; and as he went forth it fell
out.  <a name="C20V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:9</font></a> Joab said to Amasa,
Is it well with you, my brother? Joab took Amasa by the beard with his
right hand to kiss him.  <a name="C20V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:10</font></a> But Amasa took no heed to the
sword that was in Joab's hand: so he struck him therewith in the body, and
shed out his bowels to the ground, and didn't strike him again; and he
died. Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.
 <a name="C20V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:11</font></a> There stood by him one
of Joab's young men, and said, He who favors Joab, and he who is for
David, let him follow Joab.  <a name="C20V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:12</font></a> Amasa lay wallowing in his blood
in the midst of the highway. When the man saw that all the people stood
still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a
garment over him, when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still.
 <a name="C20V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:13</font></a> When he was removed out
of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba
the son of Bichri.  <a name="C20V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:14</font></a> He
went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth Maacah, and all
the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.
 <a name="C20V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:15</font></a> They came and besieged
him in Abel of Beth Maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and
it stood against the rampart; and all the people who were with Joab
battered the wall, to throw it down.  <a name="C20V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:16</font></a> Then cried a wise woman out of
the city, &quot;Hear, hear! Please say to Joab, 'Come near here, that I
may speak with you.'&quot;  <a name="C20V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:17</font></a> He came near to her; and the
woman said, Are you Joab? He answered, I am. Then she said to him, Hear
the words of your handmaid. He answered, I do hear.  <a name="C20V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:18</font></a> Then she spoke, saying, They
were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask
<I>counsel</I> at Abel: and so they ended <I>the matter</I>.  <a name="C20V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:19</font></a> I am of those who are peaceable
and faithful in Israel: you seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel:
why will you swallow up the inheritance of Yahweh?  <a name="C20V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:20</font></a> Joab answered, Far be it, far be
it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.  <a name="C20V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:21</font></a> The matter is not so: but a man
of the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has
lifted up his hand against the king, even against David; deliver him only,
and I will depart from the city. The woman said to Joab, Behold, his head
shall be thrown to you over the wall.  <a name="C20V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:22</font></a> Then the woman went to all the
people in her wisdom. They cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri,
and threw it out to Joab. He blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed
from the city, every man to his tent. Joab returned to Jerusalem to the
king.  <a name="C20V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:23</font></a> Now Joab was over
all the army of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the
Cherethites and over the Pelethites;  <a name="C20V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:24</font></a> and Adoram was over the men
subject to forced labor; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the
recorder;  <a name="C20V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:25</font></a> and Sheva was
scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;  <a name="C20V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:26</font></a> and also Ira the Jairite was
chief minister to David.
<p> <a name="C21V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:1</font></a> There was a famine in
the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face
of Yahweh. Yahweh said, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because
he put to death the Gibeonites.  <a name="C21V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:2</font></a> The king called the Gibeonites,
and said to them (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel,
but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn
to them: and Saul sought to kill them in his zeal for the children of
Israel and Judah);  <a name="C21V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:3</font></a> and
David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? And with what shall
I make atonement, that you may bless the inheritance of Yahweh?  <a name="C21V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:4</font></a> The Gibeonites said to him, It is
no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul, or his house; neither is
it for us to put any man to death in Israel. He said, What you shall say,
that will I do for you.  <a name="C21V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:5</font></a> They said to the king, The man
who consumed us, and who devised against us, <I>that</I> we should be
destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel,  <a name="C21V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:6</font></a> let seven men of his sons be
delivered to us, and we will hang them up to Yahweh in Gibeah of Saul, the
chosen of Yahweh. The king said, I will give them.  <a name="C21V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:7</font></a> But the king spared Mephibosheth,
the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of Yahweh's oath that was
between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.  <a name="C21V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:8</font></a> But the king took the two sons of
Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and
Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she
bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:  <a name="C21V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:9</font></a> He delivered them into the hands
of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before Yahweh, and
they fell <I>all</I> seven together. They were put to death in the days of
harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.  <a name="C21V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:10</font></a> Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took
sackcloth, and spread it for her on the rock, from the beginning of
harvest until water was poured on them from the sky; and she allowed
neither the birds of the sky to rest on them by day, nor the animals of
the field by night.  <a name="C21V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:11</font></a> It
was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul,
had done.  <a name="C21V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:12</font></a> David went and
took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of
Jabesh Gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth Shan, where the
Philistines had hanged them, in the day that the Philistines killed Saul
in Gilboa;  <a name="C21V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:13</font></a> and he
brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son:
and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged.  <a name="C21V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:14</font></a> They buried the bones of Saul
and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of
Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. After
that God was entreated for the land.  <a name="C21V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:15</font></a> The Philistines had war again
with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought
against the Philistines. David grew faint;  <a name="C21V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:16</font></a> and Ishbibenob, who was of the
sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred
<I>shekels</I> of brass in weight, he being girded with a new
<I>sword</I>, thought to have slain David.  <a name="C21V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:17</font></a> But Abishai the son of Zeruiah
helped him, and struck the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of
David swore to him, saying, You shall go no more out with us to battle,
that you don't quench the lamp of Israel.  <a name="C21V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:18</font></a> It came to pass after this, that
there was again war with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbecai the
Hushathite killed Saph, who was of the sons of the giant.  <a name="C21V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:19</font></a> There was again war with the
Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim the Bethlehemite
killed Goliath the Gittite's brother, the staff of whose spear was like a
weaver's beam.  <a name="C21V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:20</font></a> There was
again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had on
every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in
number; and he also was born to the giant.  <a name="C21V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:21</font></a> When he defied Israel, Jonathan
the son of Shimei, David's brother, killed him.  <a name="C21V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:22</font></a> These four were born to the
giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his
servants.
<p> <a name="C22V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:1</font></a> David spoke to Yahweh
the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered him out of the
hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:  <a name="C22V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:2</font></a> and he said,
<dl>
<dt>Yahweh is my rock,

<dd>My savior, you save me from violence.
<dt> <a name="C22V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:4</font></a> I will call on
Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised:
<dd>So shall I be saved from my enemies.

<dt> <a name="C22V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:7</font></a> In my distress I
called on Yahweh.
<dd>Yes, I called to my God.
<dt>He heard my voice out of his temple.
<dd>My cry <I>came</I> into his ears.
<dt> <a name="C22V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:8</font></a> Then the earth shook
and trembled.
<dd>The foundations of heaven quaked and were shaken,
<dd>because he was angry.
<dt> <a name="C22V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:9</font></a> Smoke went up out of
his nostrils.
<dd>Fire out of his mouth devoured.
<dd>Coals were kindled by it.
<dt> <a name="C22V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:10</font></a> He bowed the heavens
also, and came down.
<dd>Thick darkness was under his feet.
<dt> <a name="C22V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:11</font></a> He rode on a cherub,
and flew.
<dd>Yes, he was seen on the wings of the wind.
<dt> <a name="C22V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:12</font></a> He made darkness
pavilions around himself:

the day of my calamity,

<dt> <a name="C22V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:20</font></a> He also brought me
out into a large place.

according to my righteousness.
<dd>He rewarded me according to the cleanness of my hands.

<p> <a name="C23V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:1</font></a> Now these are the last
words of David.
<dl>
<dt>David the son of Jesse says,
<dd>the man who was raised on high says,
<dd>the anointed of the God of Jacob,
<dd>the sweet psalmist of Israel:
<dt> <a name="C23V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:2</font></a> The Spirit of Yahweh
spoke by me.
<dd>His word was on my tongue.
<dt> <a name="C23V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:3</font></a> The God of Israel
said,
<dd>the Rock of Israel spoke to me,
<dd>one who rules over men righteously,
<dd>who rules in the fear of God,
<dt> <a name="C23V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:4</font></a> <I>He shall be</I> as
the light of the morning, when the sun rises,

<dd>Through clear shining after rain.
<dt> <a name="C23V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:5</font></a> Most certainly my

<dd>although he doesn't make it grow.
<dt> <a name="C23V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:6</font></a> But all of the

<dt>They shall be utterly burned with fire in <I>their</I> place.
</dl>
<p> <a name="C23V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:8</font></a> These are the names of
the mighty men whom David had: Josheb Basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of
the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite, against eight hundred slain
at one time.  <a name="C23V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:9</font></a> After him
was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite, one of the three
mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines who were there
gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away.  <a name="C23V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:10</font></a> He arose, and struck the
Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand froze to the sword; and
Yahweh worked a great victory that day; and the people returned after him
only to take spoil.  <a name="C23V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:11</font></a> After him was Shammah the son of
Agee a Hararite. The Philistines were gathered together into a troop,
where there was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from
the Philistines.  <a name="C23V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:12</font></a> But he
stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and killed the
Philistines; and Yahweh worked a great victory.  <a name="C23V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:13</font></a> Three of the thirty chief men
went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam;
and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
 <a name="C23V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:14</font></a> David was then in the
stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
 <a name="C23V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:15</font></a> David longed, and said,
Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem, which
is by the gate!  <a name="C23V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:16</font></a> The
three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water
out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and
brought it to David: but he would not drink of it, but poured it out to
Yahweh.  <a name="C23V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:17</font></a> He said, Be it
far from me, Yahweh, that I should do this: <I>shall I drink</I> the blood
of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not
drink it. These things did the three mighty men.  <a name="C23V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:18</font></a> Abishai, the brother of Joab,
the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. He lifted up his spear against
three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three.  <a name="C23V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:19</font></a> Wasn't he most honorable of the
three? therefore he was made their captain: however he didn't attain to
the <I>first</I> three.  <a name="C23V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:20</font></a> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the
son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he killed the
two <I>sons of</I> Ariel of Moab: he went down also and killed a lion in
the midst of a pit in time of snow.  <a name="C23V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:21</font></a> He killed an Egyptian, a goodly
man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him
with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and killed
him with his own spear.  <a name="C23V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:22</font></a> These things did Benaiah the son
of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men.  <a name="C23V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:23</font></a> He was more honorable than the
thirty, but he didn't attain to the <I>first</I> three. David set him over

<p> <a name="C24V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:1</font></a> Again the anger of
Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them,
saying, Go, number Israel and Judah.  <a name="C24V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:2</font></a> The king said to Joab the captain
of the army, who was with him, Go now back and forth through all the
tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number you the people,
that I may know the sum of the people.  <a name="C24V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:3</font></a> Joab said to the king, Now Yahweh
your God add to the people, however many they may be, one hundred times;
and may the eyes of my lord the king see it: but why does my lord the king
delight in this thing?  <a name="C24V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:4</font></a> Notwithstanding, the king's word
prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the army. Joab and the
captains of the army went out from the presence of the king, to number the
people of Israel.  <a name="C24V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:5</font></a> They
passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right side of the
city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and to Jazer:  <a name="C24V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:6</font></a> then they came to Gilead, and to
the land of Tahtim Hodshi; and they came to Dan Jaan, and around to Sidon,
 <a name="C24V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:7</font></a> and came to the
stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the
Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beersheba.  <a name="C24V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:8</font></a> So when they had gone back and
forth through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine
months and twenty days.  <a name="C24V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:9</font></a> Joab gave up the sum of the
numbering of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight
hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword; and the men of Judah were
five hundred thousand men.  <a name="C24V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:10</font></a> David's heart struck him after
that he had numbered the people. David said to Yahweh, I have sinned
greatly in that which I have done: but now, Yahweh, put away, I beg you,
the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.  <a name="C24V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:11</font></a> When David rose up in the
morning, the word of Yahweh came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
 <a name="C24V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:12</font></a> Go and speak to David,
Thus says Yahweh, I offer you three things: choose one of them, that I may
do it to you.  <a name="C24V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:13</font></a> So Gad
came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven years of famine
come to you in your land? or will you flee three months before your foes
while they pursue you? or shall there be three days' pestilence in your
land? now advise you, and consider what answer I shall return to him who
sent me.  <a name="C24V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:14</font></a> David said to
Gad, I am in distress. Let us fall now into the hand of Yahweh; for his
mercies are great; and let me not fall into the hand of man.  <a name="C24V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:15</font></a> So Yahweh sent a pestilence on
Israel from the morning even to the time appointed; and there died of the
people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.  <a name="C24V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:16</font></a> When the angel stretched out his
hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Yahweh relented of the disaster, and
said to the angel who destroyed the people, It is enough; now stay your
hand. The angel of Yahweh was by the threshing floor of Araunah the
Jebusite.  <a name="C24V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:17</font></a> David spoke to
Yahweh when he saw the angel who struck the people, and said, Behold, I
have sinned, and I have done perversely; but these sheep, what have they
done? Please let your hand be against me, and against my father's house.
 <a name="C24V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:18</font></a> Gad came that day to
David, and said to him, Go up, rear an altar to Yahweh in the threshing
floor of Araunah the Jebusite.  <a name="C24V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:19</font></a> David went up according to the
saying of Gad, as Yahweh commanded.  <a name="C24V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:20</font></a> Araunah looked forth, and saw
the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and
bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.  <a name="C24V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:21</font></a> Araunah said, Why is my lord the
king come to his servant? David said, To buy the threshing floor of you,
to build an altar to Yahweh, that the plague may be stopped from
afflicting the people.  <a name="C24V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:22</font></a> Araunah said to David, Let my
lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him: behold, the cattle
for the burnt offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the
oxen for the wood:  <a name="C24V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:23</font></a> all
this, king, does Araunah give to the king. Araunah said to the king,
Yahweh your God accept you.  <a name="C24V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:24</font></a> The king said to Araunah, No;
but I will most certainly buy it of you at a price. Neither will I offer
burnt offerings to Yahweh my God which cost me nothing. So David bought
the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.  <a name="C24V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:25</font></a> David built there an altar to
Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So Yahweh was
entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.

<p>This file should be named web1010h.htm or web1010h.zip<br>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>
