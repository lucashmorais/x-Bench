<h1>
Ecclesiastes
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> The words of the Preacher,
the son of David, king in Jerusalem:
<p> <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> &quot;Vanity of
vanities,&quot; says the Preacher; &quot;Vanity of vanities, all is
vanity.&quot;  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> What does
man gain from all his labor in which he labors under the sun?  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> One generation goes, and another
generation comes; but the earth remains forever.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> The sun also rises, and the sun
goes down, and hurries to its place where it rises.  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> The wind goes toward the south,
and turns around to the north. It turns around continually as it goes, and
the wind returns again to its courses.  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> All the rivers run into the sea,
yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, there they
flow again.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> All things are
full of weariness beyond uttering. The eye is not satisfied with seeing,
nor the ear filled with hearing.  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> That which has been is that which
shall be; and that which has been done is that which shall be done: and
there is no new thing under the sun.  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> Is there a thing of which it may
be said, &quot;Behold, this is new?&quot; It has been long ago, in the
ages which were before us.  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> There is no memory of the former;
neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come, among
those that shall come after.
<p> <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> I, the Preacher, was
king over Israel in Jerusalem.  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> I applied my heart to seek and to
search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky. It is a
heavy burden that God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.
 <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> I have seen all the works
that are done under the sun; and behold, all is vanity and a chasing after
wind.  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> That which is
crooked can't be made straight; and that which is lacking can't be
counted.  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> I said to
myself, &quot;Behold, I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all
who were before me in Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has had great experience of
wisdom and knowledge.&quot;  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> I applied my heart to know
wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a
chasing after wind.  <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> For
in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases
sorrow.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> I said in my heart,
&quot;Come now, I will test you with mirth: therefore enjoy
pleasure;&quot; and behold, this also was vanity.  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> I said of laughter, &quot;It is
foolishness;&quot; and of mirth, &quot;What does it accomplish?&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> I searched in my heart
how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart yet guiding me with wisdom, and
how to lay hold of folly, until I might see what it was good for the sons
of men that they should do under heaven all the days of their lives.
 <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> I made myself great works.
I built myself houses. I planted myself vineyards.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> I made myself gardens and parks,
and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit.  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> I made myself pools of water, to
water from it the forest where trees were reared.  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> I bought male servants and female
servants, and had servants born in my house. I also had great possessions
of herds and flocks, above all who were before me in Jerusalem;  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> I also gathered silver and gold
for myself, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces. I got myself
male and female singers, and the delights of the sons of men--musical
instruments, and that of all sorts.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> So I was great, and increased more
than all who were before me in Jerusalem. My wisdom also remained with me.
 <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> Whatever my eyes desired,
I didn't keep from them. I didn't withhold my heart from any joy, for my
heart rejoiced because of all my labor, and this was my portion from all
my labor.  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> Then I looked
at all the works that my hands had worked, and at the labor that I had
labored to do; and behold, all was vanity and a chasing after wind, and
there was no profit under the sun.
<p> <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> I turned myself to
consider wisdom, madness, and folly: for what can the king's successor do?
Just that which has been done long ago.  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> Then I saw that wisdom excels
folly, as far as light excels darkness.  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> The wise man's eyes are in his
head, and the fool walks in darkness--and yet I perceived that one event
happens to them all.  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> Then
said I in my heart, &quot;As it happens to the fool, so will it happen
even to me; and why was I then more wise?&quot; Then said I in my heart
that this also is vanity.  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> For of the wise man, even as of
the fool, there is no memory for ever, seeing that in the days to come all
will have been long forgotten. Indeed, the wise man must die just like the
fool!
<p> <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> So I hated life,
because the work that is worked under the sun was grievous to me; for all
is vanity and a chasing after wind.  <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> I hated all my labor in which I
labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it to the man who comes
after me.  <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> Who knows
whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have rule over all of
my labor in which I have labored, and in which I have shown myself wise
under the sun. This also is vanity.
<p> <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> Therefore I began to
cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor in which I had labored
under the sun.  <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> For there
is a man whose labor is with wisdom, with knowledge, and with
skillfulness; yet he shall leave it for his portion to a man who has not
labored for it. This also is vanity and a great evil.  <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> For what has a man of all his
labor, and of the striving of his heart, in which he labors under the sun?
 <a name="C2V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:23</font></a> For all his days are
sorrows, and his travail is grief; yes, even in the night his heart takes
no rest. This also is vanity.  <a name="C2V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:24</font></a> There is nothing better for a man
than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his
labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.  <a name="C2V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:25</font></a> For who can eat, or who can have
enjoyment, more than I?  <a name="C2V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:26</font></a> For to the man who pleases him,
God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he gives travail,
to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him who pleases God. This
also is vanity and a chasing after wind.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> For everything there is
a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven:
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> a time to be born,
<dd>and a time to die;
<dt>a time to plant,
<dd>and a time to pluck up that which is planted;
<dt> <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> a time to kill,
<dd>and a time to heal;
<dt>a time to break down,
<dd>and a time to build up;
<dt> <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> a time to weep,
<dd>and a time to laugh;
<dt>a time to mourn,
<dd>and a time to dance;
<dt> <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> a time to cast away
stones,
<dd>and a time to gather stones together;
<dt>a time to embrace,
<dd>and a time to refrain from embracing;
<dt> <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> a time to seek,
<dd>and a time to lose;
<dt>a time to keep,
<dd>and a time to cast away;
<dt> <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> a time to tear,
<dd>and a time to sew;
<dt>a time to keep silence,
<dd>and a time to speak;
<dt> <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> a time to love,
<dd>and a time to hate;
<dt>a time for war,
<dd>and a time for peace.
</dl>
<p> <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> What profit has he who
works in that in which he labors?  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> I have seen the burden which God
has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> He has made everything beautiful
in its time. He has also set eternity in their hearts, yet so that man
can't find out the work that God has done from the beginning even to the
end.  <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> I know that there is
nothing better for them than to rejoice, and to do good as long as they
live.  <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> Also that every man
should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labor, is the gift of God.
 <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> I know that whatever God
does, it shall be forever. Nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken
from it; and God has done it, that men should fear before him.  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> That which is has been long ago,
and that which is to be has been long ago: and God seeks again that which
is passed away.
<p> <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> Moreover I saw under
the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the
place of righteousness, that wickedness was there.  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> I said in my heart, &quot;God
will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for
every purpose and for every work.&quot;  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> I said in my heart, &quot;As for
the sons of men, God tests them, so that they may see that they themselves
are like animals.  <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> For
that which happens to the sons of men happens to animals. Even one thing
happens to them. As the one dies, so the other dies. Yes, they have all
one breath; and man has no advantage over the animals: for all is vanity.
 <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> All go to one place. All
are from the dust, and all turn to dust again.  <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> Who knows the spirit of man,
whether it goes upward, and the spirit of the animal, whether it goes
downward to the earth?&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:22</font></a> Therefore I saw that
there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works; for
that is his portion: for who can bring him to see what will be after him?
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> Then I returned and saw
all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold, the tears of
those who were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of
their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> Therefore I praised the dead who
have been long dead more than the living who are yet alive.  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> Yes, better than them both is him
who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under
the sun.  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> Then I saw all
the labor and achievement that is the envy of a man's neighbor. This also
is vanity and a striving after wind.  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> The fool folds his hands together
and ruins himself.
<p> <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> Better is a handful,
with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and chasing after wind.
 <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> Then I returned and saw
vanity under the sun.  <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> There is one who is alone, and he
has neither son nor brother. There is no end to all of his labor, neither
are his eyes satisfied with wealth. For whom then, do I labor, and deprive
my soul of enjoyment? This also is vanity, yes, it is a miserable business.
<p> <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> Two are better than
one, because they have a good reward for their labor.  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> For if they fall, the one will
lift up his fellow; but woe to him who is alone when he falls, and doesn't
have another to lift him up.  <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> Again, if two lie together, then
they have warmth; but how can one keep warm alone?  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> If a man prevails against one who
is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly
broken.
<p> <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> Better is a poor and
wise youth than an old and foolish king who doesn't know how to receive
admonition any more.  <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> For
out of prison he came forth to be king; yes, even in his kingdom he was
born poor.  <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> I saw all the
living who walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the other,
who succeeded him.  <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> There
was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was--yet those
who come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a
chasing after wind.
<p> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> Guard your steps when
you go to God's house; for to draw near to listen is better than to give
the sacrifice of fools, for they don't know that they do evil.  <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> Don't be rash with your mouth, and
don't let your heart be hasty to utter anything before God; for God is in
heaven, and you on earth. Therefore let your words be few.  <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> For as a dream comes with a
multitude of cares, so a fool's speech with a multitude of words.  <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> When you vow a vow to God, don't
defer to pay it; for he has no pleasure in fools. Pay that which you vow.
 <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> It is better that you
should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay.  <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> Don't allow your mouth to lead you
into sin. Don't protest before the messenger that this was a mistake. Why
should God be angry at your voice, and destroy the work of your hands?
 <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> For in the multitude of
dreams there are vanities, as well as in many words: but you must fear God.
<p> <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> If you see the
oppression of the poor, and the violent taking away of justice and
righteousness in a district, don't marvel at the matter: for one official
is eyed by a higher one; and there are officials over them.  <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> Moreover the profit of the earth
is for all. The king profits from the field.
<p> <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> He who loves silver
shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he who loves abundance, with
increase: this also is vanity.  <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> When goods increase, those who
eat them are increased; and what advantage is there to its owner, except
to feast on them with his eyes?
<p> <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> The sleep of a
laboring man is sweet, whether he eats little or much; but the abundance
of the rich will not allow him to sleep.
<p> <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> There is a grievous
evil which I have seen under the sun: wealth kept by its owner to his
harm.  <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> Those riches perish
by misfortune, and if he has fathered a son, there is nothing in his hand.
 <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> As he came forth from his
mother's womb, naked shall he go again as he came, and shall take nothing
for his labor, which he may carry away in his hand.  <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> This also is a grievous evil,
that in all points as he came, so shall he go. And what profit does he
have who labors for the wind?  <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> All his days he also eats in
darkness, he is frustrated, and has sickness and wrath.
<p> <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> Behold, that which I
have seen to be good and proper is for one to eat and to drink, and to
enjoy good in all his labor, in which he labors under the sun, all the
days of his life which God has given him; for this is his portion.  <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> Every man also to whom God has
given riches and wealth, and has given him power to eat of it, and to take
his portion, and to rejoice in his labor--this is the gift of God.  <a name="C5V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:20</font></a> For he shall not often reflect on
the days of his life; because God occupies him with the joy of his heart.
<p> <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> There is an evil which
I have seen under the sun, and it is heavy on men:  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> a man to whom God gives riches,
wealth, and honor, so that he lacks nothing for his soul of all that he
desires, yet God gives him no power to eat of it, but an alien eats it.
This is vanity, and it is an evil disease.
<p> <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> If a man fathers a
hundred children, and lives many years, so that the days of his years are
many, but his soul is not filled with good, and moreover he has no burial;
I say, that an untimely birth is better than he:  <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> for it comes in vanity, and
departs in darkness, and its name is covered with darkness.  <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> Moreover it has not seen the sun
nor known it. This has rest rather than the other.  <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> Yes, though he live a thousand
years twice told, and yet fails to enjoy good, don't all go to one place?
 <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> All the labor of man is
for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.  <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> For what advantage has the wise
more than the fool? What has the poor man, that knows how to walk before
the living?  <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> Better is the
sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire. This also is vanity
and a chasing after wind.  <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> Whatever has been, its name was
given long ago; and it is known what man is; neither can he contend with
him who is mightier than he.  <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> For there are many words that
create vanity. What does that profit man?  <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> For who knows what is good for
man in life, all the days of his vain life which he spends like a shadow?
For who can tell a man what will be after him under the sun?
<p> <a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> A good name is better
than fine perfume; and the day of death better than the day of one's
birth.  <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> It is better to go
to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting: for that is
the end of all men, and the living should take this to heart.  <a name="C7V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:3</font></a> Sorrow is better than laughter;
for by the sadness of the face the heart is made good.  <a name="C7V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:4</font></a> The heart of the wise is in the
house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.
 <a name="C7V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:5</font></a> It is better to hear the
rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.  <a name="C7V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:6</font></a> For as the crackling of thorns
under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This also is vanity.  <a name="C7V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:7</font></a> Surely extortion makes the wise
man foolish; and a bribe destroys the understanding.  <a name="C7V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:8</font></a> Better is the end of a thing than
its beginning.
<p>The patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.  <a name="C7V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:9</font></a> Don't be hasty in your spirit to
be angry, for anger rests in the bosom of fools.  <a name="C7V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:10</font></a> Don't say, &quot;Why were the
former days better than these?&quot; For you do not ask wisely about this.
<p> <a name="C7V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:11</font></a> Wisdom is as good as
an inheritance. Yes, it is more excellent for those who see the sun.
 <a name="C7V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:12</font></a> For wisdom is a defense,
even as money is a defense; but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom
preserves the life of him who has it.
<p> <a name="C7V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:13</font></a> Consider the work of
God, for who can make that straight, which he has made crooked?  <a name="C7V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:14</font></a> In the day of prosperity be
joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; yes, God has made the one
side by side with the other, to the end that man should not find out
anything after him.
<p> <a name="C7V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:15</font></a> All this have I seen
in my days of vanity: there is a righteous man who perishes in his
righteousness, and there is a wicked man who lives long in his evil-doing.
 <a name="C7V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:16</font></a> Don't be overly
righteous, neither make yourself overly wise. Why should you destroy
yourself?  <a name="C7V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:17</font></a> Don't be too
wicked, neither be foolish. Why should you die before your time?  <a name="C7V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:18</font></a> It is good that you should take
hold of this. Yes, also from that don't withdraw your hand; for he who
fears God will come forth from them all.  <a name="C7V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:19</font></a> Wisdom is a strength to the wise
man more than ten rulers who are in a city.  <a name="C7V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:20</font></a> Surely there is not a righteous
man on earth, who does good and doesn't sin.  <a name="C7V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:21</font></a> Also don't take heed to all words
that are spoken, lest you hear your servant curse you;  <a name="C7V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:22</font></a> for often your own heart knows
that you yourself have likewise cursed others.  <a name="C7V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:23</font></a> All this have I proved in wisdom.
I said, &quot;I will be wise;&quot; but it was far from me.  <a name="C7V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:24</font></a> That which is, is far off and
exceedingly deep. Who can find it out?  <a name="C7V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:25</font></a> I turned around, and my heart
sought to know and to search out, and to seek wisdom and the scheme of
things, and to know that wickedness is stupidity, and that foolishness is
madness.
<p> <a name="C7V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:26</font></a> I find more bitter
than death the woman whose heart is snares and traps, whose hands are
chains. Whoever pleases God shall escape from her; but the sinner will be
ensnared by her.
<p> <a name="C7V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:27</font></a> Behold, this have I
found, says the Preacher, one to another, to find out the scheme;  <a name="C7V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:28</font></a> which my soul still seeks; but I
have not found: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among
all those have I not found.  <a name="C7V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:29</font></a> Behold, this only have I found:
that God made man upright; but they search for many schemes.
<p> <a name="C8V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:1</font></a> Who is like the wise
man? And who knows the interpretation of a thing? A man's wisdom makes his
face shine, and the hardness of his face is changed.  <a name="C8V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:2</font></a> I say, &quot;Keep the king's
command!&quot; because of the oath to God.  <a name="C8V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:3</font></a> Don't be hasty to go out of his
presence. Don't persist in an evil thing, for he does whatever pleases
him,  <a name="C8V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:4</font></a> for the king's word
is supreme. Who can say to him, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;  <a name="C8V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:5</font></a> Whoever keeps the commandment
shall not come to harm, and his wise heart will know the time and
procedure.  <a name="C8V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:6</font></a> For there is a
time and procedure for every purpose, although the misery of man is heavy
on him.  <a name="C8V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:7</font></a> For he doesn't
know that which will be; for who can tell him how it will be?  <a name="C8V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:8</font></a> There is no man who has power over
the spirit to contain the spirit; neither does he have power over the day
of death. There is no discharge in war; neither shall wickedness deliver
those who practice it.
<p> <a name="C8V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:9</font></a> All this have I seen,
and applied my mind to every work that is done under the sun. There is a
time in which one man has power over another to his hurt.  <a name="C8V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:10</font></a> So I saw the wicked buried.
Indeed they came also from holiness. They went and were forgotten in the
city where they did this. This also is vanity.  <a name="C8V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:11</font></a> Because sentence against an evil
work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is
fully set in them to do evil.  <a name="C8V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:12</font></a> Though a sinner commits crimes a
hundred times, and lives long, yet surely I know that it will be better
with those who fear God, who are reverent before him.  <a name="C8V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:13</font></a> But it shall not be well with the
wicked, neither shall he lengthen days like a shadow; because he doesn't
fear God.
<p> <a name="C8V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:14</font></a> There is a vanity
which is done on the earth, that there are righteous men to whom it
happens according to the work of the wicked. Again, there are wicked men
to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous. I said that
this also is vanity.  <a name="C8V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:15</font></a> Then
I commended mirth, because a man has no better thing under the sun, than
to eat, and to drink, and to be joyful: for that will accompany him in his
labor all the days of his life which God has given him under the sun.
<p> <a name="C8V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:16</font></a> When I applied my
heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done on the earth
(for also there is that neither day nor night sees sleep with his eyes),
 <a name="C8V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:17</font></a> then I saw all the work
of God, that man can't find out the work that is done under the sun,
because however much a man labors to seek it out, yet he won't find it.
Yes even though a wise man thinks he can comprehend it, he won't be able
to find it.
<p> <a name="C9V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:1</font></a> For all this I laid to
my heart, even to explore all this: that the righteous, and the wise, and
their works, are in the hand of God; whether it is love or hatred, man
doesn't know it; all is before them.  <a name="C9V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:2</font></a> All things come alike to all.
There is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good, to the
clean, to the unclean, to him who sacrifices, and to him who doesn't
sacrifice. As is the good, so is the sinner; he who takes an oath, as he
who fears an oath.  <a name="C9V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:3</font></a> This is
an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one event to all:
yes also, the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in
their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.  <a name="C9V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:4</font></a> For to him who is joined with all
the living there is hope; for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
 <a name="C9V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:5</font></a> For the living know that
they will die, but the dead don't know anything, neither do they have any
more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.  <a name="C9V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:6</font></a> Also their love, their hatred, and
their envy has perished long ago; neither have they any more a portion
forever in anything that is done under the sun.
<p> <a name="C9V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:7</font></a> Go your way--eat your
bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God has
already accepted your works.  <a name="C9V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:8</font></a> Let your garments be always white,
and don't let your head lack oil.  <a name="C9V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:9</font></a> Live joyfully with the wife whom
you love all the days of your life of vanity, which he has given you under
the sun, all your days of vanity: for that is your portion in life, and in
your labor in which you labor under the sun.  <a name="C9V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:10</font></a> Whatever your hand finds to do,
do it with your might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge,
nor wisdom, in Sheol, where you are going.
<p> <a name="C9V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:11</font></a> I returned, and saw
under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the
strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of
understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happen
to them all.  <a name="C9V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:12</font></a> For man also
doesn't know his time. As the fish that are taken in an evil net, and as
the birds that are caught in the snare, even so are the sons of men snared
in an evil time, when it falls suddenly on them.
<p> <a name="C9V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:13</font></a> I have also seen
wisdom under the sun in this way, and it seemed great to me.  <a name="C9V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:14</font></a> There was a little city, and few
men within it; and a great king came against it, besieged it, and built
great bulwarks against it.  <a name="C9V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:15</font></a> Now a poor wise man was found in
it, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that
same poor man.  <a name="C9V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:16</font></a> Then said
I, Wisdom is better than strength. Nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is
despised, and his words are not heard.  <a name="C9V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:17</font></a> The words of the wise heard in
quiet are better than the cry of him who rules among fools.  <a name="C9V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:18</font></a> Wisdom is better than weapons of
war; but one sinner destroys much good.
<p> <a name="C10V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:1</font></a> Dead flies cause the
oil of the perfumer to send forth an evil odor; so does a little folly
outweigh wisdom and honor.  <a name="C10V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:2</font></a> A wise man's heart is at his
right hand, but a fool's heart at his left.  <a name="C10V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:3</font></a> Yes also, when the fool walks by
the way, his understanding fails him, and he says to everyone that he is a
fool.  <a name="C10V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:4</font></a> If the spirit of
the ruler rises up against you, don't leave your place; for gentleness
lays great offenses to rest.
<p> <a name="C10V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:5</font></a> There is an evil which
I have seen under the sun, the sort of error which proceeds from the
ruler.  <a name="C10V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:6</font></a> Folly is set in
great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place.  <a name="C10V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:7</font></a> I have seen servants on horses,
and princes walking like servants on the earth.  <a name="C10V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:8</font></a> He who digs a pit may fall into
it; and whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.  <a name="C10V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:9</font></a> Whoever carves out stones may be
injured by them. Whoever splits wood may be endangered thereby.  <a name="C10V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:10</font></a> If the axe is blunt, and one
doesn't sharpen the edge, then he must use more strength; but skill brings
success.
<p> <a name="C10V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:11</font></a> If the snake bites
before it is charmed, then is there no profit for the charmer's tongue.
 <a name="C10V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:12</font></a> The words of a wise
man's mouth are gracious; but a fool is swallowed by his own lips.  <a name="C10V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:13</font></a> The beginning of the words of
his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.
 <a name="C10V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:14</font></a> A fool also multiplies
words.
<p>Man doesn't know what will be; and that which will be after him, who
can tell him?  <a name="C10V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:15</font></a> The labor
of fools wearies every one of them; for he doesn't know how to go to the
city.
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C10V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:16</font></a> Woe to you, land,
when your king is a child,
<dd>and your princes eat in the morning!  <a name="C10V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:17</font></a> Happy are you, land, when your
king is the son of nobles,
<dd>and your princes eat in due season,
<dd>for strength, and not for drunkenness!
<dt> <a name="C10V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:18</font></a> By slothfulness the
roof sinks in;
<dd>and through idleness of the hands the house leaks.
<dt> <a name="C10V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:19</font></a> A feast is made for
laughter,
<dd>and wine makes the life glad;
<dd>and money is the answer for all things.
<dt> <a name="C10V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:20</font></a> Don't curse the
king, no, not in your thoughts;
<dd>and don't curse the rich in your bedchamber:
<dd>for a bird of the sky may carry your voice,
<dd>and that which has wings may tell the matter.
<dt>
</dl>
<dl> <dt><a name="C11V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:1</font></a> Cast your bread on
the waters;
<dd>for you shall find it after many days.
<dt> <a name="C11V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:2</font></a> Give a portion to
seven, yes, even to eight;
<dd>for you don't know what evil will be on the earth.
<dt> <a name="C11V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:3</font></a> If the clouds are
full of rain, they empty themselves on the earth;
<dd>and if a tree falls toward the south, or toward the north,
<dd>in the place where the tree falls, there shall it be.
<dt> <a name="C11V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:4</font></a> He who observes the
wind won't sow;
<dd>and he who regards the clouds won't reap.
<dt> <a name="C11V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:5</font></a> As you don't know
what is the way of the wind,
<dd>nor how the bones grow in the womb of her who is with child;
<dd>even so you don't know the work of God who does all.
<dt> <a name="C11V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:6</font></a> In the morning sow
your seed,
<dd>and in the evening don't withhold your hand;
<dd>for you don't know which will prosper, whether this or that,
<dd>or whether they both will be equally good.
<dt> <a name="C11V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:7</font></a> Truly the light is
sweet,
<dd>and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to see the sun.
<dt> <a name="C11V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:8</font></a> Yes, if a man lives
many years, let him rejoice in them all;
<dd>but let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many.
<dd>All that comes is vanity.
<dt> <a name="C11V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:9</font></a> Rejoice, young man,
in your youth,
<dd>and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth,
<dd>and walk in the ways of your heart,
<dd>and in the sight of your eyes;
<dd>but know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.
<dt> <a name="C11V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:10</font></a> Therefore remove
sorrow from your heart,
<dd>and put away evil from your flesh;
<dd>for youth and the dawn of life are vanity.
<dt>
</dl>
<dl> <dt><a name="C12V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:1</font></a> Remember also your
Creator in the days of your youth,
<dd>before the evil days come, and the years draw near,
<dd>when you will say, &quot;I have no pleasure in them;&quot;
<dt> <a name="C12V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:2</font></a> Before the sun, the
light, the moon, and the stars are darkened,
<dd>and the clouds return after the rain;
<dt> <a name="C12V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:3</font></a> in the day when the
keepers of the house shall tremble,
<dd>and the strong men shall bow themselves,
<dd>and the grinders cease because they are few,
<dd>and those who look out of the windows are darkened,
<dt> <a name="C12V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:4</font></a> and the doors shall
be shut in the street;
<dd>when the sound of the grinding is low,
<dd>and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird,
<dd>and all the daughters of music shall be brought low;
<dt> <a name="C12V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:5</font></a> yes, they shall be
afraid of heights,
<dd>and terrors will be in the way;
<dd>and the almond tree shall blossom,
<dd>and the grasshopper shall be a burden,
<dd>and desire shall fail;
<dd>because man goes to his everlasting home,
<dd>and the mourners go about the streets:
<dt> <a name="C12V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:6</font></a> before the silver
cord is severed,
<dd>or the golden bowl is broken,
<dd>or the pitcher is broken at the spring,
<dd>or the wheel broken at the cistern,
<dt> <a name="C12V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:7</font></a> and the dust returns
to the earth as it was,
<dd>and the spirit returns to God who gave it.
<dd> <a name="C12V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:8</font></a> Vanity of vanities,
says the Preacher.
<dd>All is vanity!
</dl>
<p> <a name="C12V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:9</font></a> Further, because the
Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge. Yes, he pondered,
sought out, and set in order many proverbs.  <a name="C12V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:10</font></a> The Preacher sought to find out
acceptable words, and that which was written blamelessly, words of truth.
 <a name="C12V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:11</font></a> The words of the wise
are like goads; and like nails well fastened are words from the masters of
assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.  <a name="C12V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:12</font></a> Furthermore, my son, be
admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a
weariness of the flesh.
<p> <a name="C12V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:13</font></a> This is the end of
the matter. All has been heard. Fear God, and keep his commandments; for
this is the whole duty of man.  <a name="C12V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:14</font></a> For God will bring every work
into judgment, with every hidden thing, whether it is good, or whether it
is evil.

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>In answer to various questions we have received on this:</p>

<p>We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally<br>
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with<br>

someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our<br>
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth<br>
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
