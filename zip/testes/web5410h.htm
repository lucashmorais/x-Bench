<h1>
Paul's First Letter to Timothy
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> Paul, an apostle of Christ
Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior, and Christ Jesus our
hope;  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> to Timothy, my true
child in faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Christ
Jesus our Lord.
<p> <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> As I urged you when I
was going into Macedonia, stay at Ephesus that you might command certain
men not to teach a different doctrine,  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> neither to pay attention to myths
and endless genealogies, which cause disputes, rather than God's
stewardship, which is in faith-- <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> but the goal of this command is
love, out of a pure heart and a good conscience and unfeigned faith;
 <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> from which things some,
having missed the mark, have turned aside to vain talking;  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> desiring to be teachers of the
law, though they understand neither what they say, nor about what they
strongly affirm.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> But we
know that the law is good, if a man uses it lawfully,  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> as knowing this, that law is not
made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the
ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers
and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> for the sexually immoral, for
homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for any
other thing contrary to the sound doctrine;  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> according to the Good News of the
glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> And I thank him who enabled me,
Christ Jesus our Lord, because he counted me faithful, appointing me to
service;  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> although I was
before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent. However, I obtained
mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> The grace of our Lord abounded
exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> The saying is faithful and worthy
of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners;
of whom I am chief.  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> However, for this cause I
obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might display all his
patience, for an example of those who were going to believe in him for
eternal life.  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> Now to the
King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and
glory forever and ever. Amen.
<p> <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> This instruction I
commit to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which led the
way to you, that by them you may wage the good warfare;  <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> holding faith and a good
conscience; which some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the
faith;  <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> of whom is
Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered to Satan, that they might be
taught not to blaspheme.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> I exhort therefore,
first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and givings of
thanks, be made for all men:  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> for kings and all who are in high
places; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and
reverence.  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> For this is
good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior;  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> who desires all people to be saved
and come to full knowledge of the truth.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> For there is one God, and one
mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> who gave himself as a ransom for
all; the testimony in its own times;  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> to which I was appointed a
preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth in Christ, not lying), a
teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
<p> <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> I desire therefore that
the men in every place pray, lifting up holy hands without anger and
doubting.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> In the same way,
that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and
propriety; not just with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive
clothing;  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> but (which
becomes women professing godliness) with good works.  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> Let a woman learn in quietness
with all subjection.  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> But
I don't permit a woman to teach, nor to exercise authority over a man, but
to be in quietness.  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> For
Adam was first formed, then Eve.  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> Adam wasn't deceived, but the
woman, being deceived, has fallen into disobedience;  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> but she will be saved through her
childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and sanctification with
sobriety.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> This is a faithful
saying: if a man seeks the office of an <a href="#N1">overseer</a>, he
desires a good work.  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> The
overseer therefore must be without reproach, the husband of one wife,
temperate, sensible, modest, hospitable, good at teaching;  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> not a drinker, not violent, not
greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous;  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> one who rules his own house well,
having children in subjection with all reverence;  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> (but if a man doesn't know how to
rule his own house, how will he take care of the assembly of God?)  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> not a new convert, lest being
puffed up he fall into the same condemnation as the devil.  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> Moreover he must have good
testimony from those who are outside, to avoid falling into reproach and
the snare of the devil.
<p> <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> <a
href="#N2">Servants</a>, in the same way, must be reverent, not
double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for money;  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> holding the mystery of the faith
in a pure conscience.  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> Let
them also first be tested; then let them <a href="#N3">serve</a> if they
are blameless.  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> Their
wives in the same way must be reverent, not slanderers, temperate,
faithful in all things.  <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> Let <a href="#N4">servants</a> be
husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.
 <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> For those who have <a
href="#N5">served well</a> gain for themselves a good standing, and great
boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
<p> <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> These things I write
to you, hoping to come to you shortly;  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> but if I wait long, that you may
know how men ought to behave themselves in the house of God, which is the
assembly of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.  <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> Without controversy, the mystery
of godliness is great:
<dl>
<dt>God was revealed in the flesh,
<dd>justified in the spirit,
<dd>seen by angels,
<dd>preached among the nations,
<dd>believed on in the world,
<dd>and received up in glory.
</dl>
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> But the Spirit says
expressly that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying
attention to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons,  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> through the hypocrisy of men who
speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron;  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> forbidding marriage and commanding
to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving
by those who believe and know the truth.  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> For every creature of God is good,
and nothing is to be rejected, if it is received with thanksgiving.
 <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> For it is sanctified
through the word of God and prayer.  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> If you instruct the brothers of
these things, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished in the
words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which you have followed.
 <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> But refuse profane and old
wives' fables. Exercise yourself toward godliness.  <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> For bodily exercise has some
value, but godliness has value in all things, having the promise of the
life which is now, and of that which is to come.  <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> This saying is faithful and worthy
of all acceptance.  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> For to
this end we both labor and suffer reproach, because we have set our trust
in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who
believe.  <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> Command and
teach these things.
<p> <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> Let no man despise
your youth; but be an example to those who believe, in word, in your way
of life, in love, in spirit, in faith, and in purity.  <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> Until I come, pay attention to
reading, to exhortation, and to teaching.  <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> Don't neglect the gift that is in
you, which was given to you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands
of the elders.  <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> Be
diligent in these things. Give yourself wholly to them, that your progress
may be revealed to all.  <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> Pay attention to yourself, and to
your teaching. Continue in these things, for in doing this you will save
both yourself and those who hear you.
<p> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> Don't rebuke an older
man, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brothers;  <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> the elder women as mothers; the
younger as sisters, in all purity.  <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> Honor widows who are widows
indeed.  <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> But if any widow
has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety towards
their own family, and to repay their parents, for this is<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N6">*</a></sup></font> acceptable
in the sight of God.  <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> Now
she who is a widow indeed, and desolate, has her hope set on God, and
continues in petitions and prayers night and day.  <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> But she who gives herself to
pleasure is dead while she lives.  <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> Also command these things, that
they may be without reproach.  <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> But if anyone doesn't provide for
his own, and especially his own household, he has denied the faith, and is
worse than an unbeliever.  <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> Let no one be enrolled as a widow
under sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,  <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> being approved by good works, if
she has brought up children, if she has been hospitable to strangers, if
she has washed the saints' feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, and if
she has diligently followed every good work.
<p> <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> But refuse younger
widows, for when they have grown wanton against Christ, they desire to
marry;  <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> having
condemnation, because they have rejected their first pledge.  <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> Besides, they also learn to be
idle, going about from house to house. Not only idle, but also gossips and
busybodies, saying things which they ought not.  <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> I desire therefore that the
younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, and give no
occasion to the adversary for reviling.  <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> For already some have turned
aside after Satan.  <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> If any
man or woman who believes has widows, let them relieve them, and don't let
the assembly be burdened; that it might relieve those who are widows
indeed.
<p> <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> Let the elders who
rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in
the word and in teaching.  <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> For the Scripture says, &quot;You
shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain.&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N7">*</a></sup></font> And,
&quot;The laborer is worthy of his wages.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N8">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> Don't receive an
accusation against an elder, except at the word of two or three witnesses.
 <a name="C5V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:20</font></a> Those who sin, reprove in
the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear.  <a name="C5V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:21</font></a> I command you in the sight of
God, and Christ Jesus, and the chosen angels, that you observe these
things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.  <a name="C5V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:22</font></a> Lay hands hastily on no one,
neither be a participant in other men's sins. Keep yourself pure.  <a name="C5V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:23</font></a> Be no longer a drinker of water
only, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your frequent
infirmities.
<p> <a name="C5V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:24</font></a> Some men's sins are
evident, preceding them to judgment, and some also follow later.  <a name="C5V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:25</font></a> In the same way also there are
good works that are obvious, and those that are otherwise can't be hidden.
<p> <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> Let as many as are
bondservants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor,
that the name of God and the doctrine not be blasphemed.  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> Those who have believing masters,
let them not despise them, because they are brothers, but rather let them
serve them, because those who partake of the benefit are believing and
beloved. Teach and exhort these things.
<p> <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> If anyone teaches a
different doctrine, and doesn't consent to sound words, the words of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness,
 <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> he is conceited, knowing
nothing, but obsessed with arguments, disputes, and word battles, from
which come envy, strife, reviling, evil suspicions,  <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> constant friction of people of
corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a
means of gain. <a href="#N9">Withdraw yourself from such.</a>
<p> <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> But godliness with
contentment is great gain.  <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> For we brought nothing into the
world, and we certainly can't carry anything out.  <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> But having food and clothing, we
will be content with that.  <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> But those who are determined to be
rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful
lusts, such as drown men in ruin and destruction.  <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> For the love of money is a root
of all kinds of evil. Some have been led astray from the faith in their
greed, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
<p> <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> But you, man of God,
flee these things, and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love,
patience, and gentleness.  <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> Fight the good fight of faith.
Lay hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and you confessed
the good confession in the sight of many witnesses.  <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> I command you before God, who
gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius
Pilate testified the good confession,  <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> that you keep the commandment
without spot, blameless, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ;
 <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> which in its own times he
will show, who is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings, and Lord
of lords;  <a name="C6V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:16</font></a> who alone has
immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor
can see: to whom be honor and eternal power. Amen.
<p> <a name="C6V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:17</font></a> Charge those who are
rich in this present world that they not be haughty, nor have their hope
set on the uncertainty of riches, but on the living God, who richly
provides us with everything to enjoy;  <a name="C6V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:18</font></a> that they do good, that they be
rich in good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing to
communicate;  <a name="C6V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:19</font></a> laying up in
store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they
may lay hold of eternal life.
<p> <a name="C6V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:20</font></a> Timothy, guard that
which is committed to you, turning away from the empty chatter and
oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called;  <a name="C6V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:21</font></a> which some professing have erred
concerning the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.

of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Just search by the first five letters of the filename you
want,<br>as it appears in our Newsletters.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with<br>
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from<br>
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our<br>
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth<br>
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
