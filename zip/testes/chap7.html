<b>STRUCTURE OF THE HEART IN THE EDRIOPHTHALMA</b></center>

<br>
<br>
 

<p class="one">Let us first glance over the extant facts.</p>

<p>Among the Stalk-eyed Crustacea (<i>Podophthalma</i>) we know
only a very few species which quit the egg in the form of their
parents, with the full number of well-jointed appendages to the
body. This is the case according to Rathke<a href=
"#1."><sup>1</sup></a> in the European fresh-water Crayfish, and
according to Westwood in a West Indian Land Crab
(<i>Gecarcinus</i>). Both exceptions therefore belong to the small
number of Stalk-eyed Crustacea which live in fresh water or on the
land, as indeed in many other cases fresh-water and terrestrial
animals undergo no transformations, whilst their allies in the sea
have a metamorphosis to undergo. I may refer to the Earthworms and
Leeches among the Annelida, which chiefly belong to the land and to
fresh water,&mdash;to the <i>Planari&aelig;</i> of the fresh waters
and the <i>Tetrastemma</i> of the sparingly saline Baltic among the
Turbellaria,&mdash;to the Pulmonate Gasteropoda, and to the
Branchiferous Gasteropoda of the fresh waters, the young of which
(according to Troschel&rsquo;s &lsquo;Handb. der Zoologie&rsquo;)
have no ciliated buccal lobes, although such organs are possessed
by the very similar Periwinkles (<i>Littorina</i>).</p>

<p>All the marine forms of this section appear to be subject to a
more or less considerable metamorphosis. This appears to be only
inconsiderable in the common Lobster, the young of which, according
to Van Beneden, are distinguished from the adult animal, by having
their feet furnished, like those of <i>Mysis,</i> with a swimming
branch projecting freely outwards. From a figure given by Couch the
appendages of the abdomen and tail also appear to be wanting.</p>

<p>Far more profound is the difference of the youngest brood from
the sexually mature animal in by far the greater majority of the
Podophthalma, which quit the egg in the form of <i>Zo&euml;a.</i>
This young form occurs, so far as our present observations go, in
all the Crabs, with the sole exception of the single species
investigated by Westwood. I say <i>species,</i> and not <i>
genus,</i> for in the same genus, <i>Gecarcinus,</i> Vaughan
Thompson found Zo&euml;a-brood,<a href="#2."><sup>2</sup></a> which
is also met with in other terrestrial Crabs (<i>Ocypoda,
Gelasimus,</i> etc.). All the Anomura seem likewise to commence
their lives as Zo&euml;&aelig;: witness the <i>
Porcellan&aelig;,</i> the Tatuira (<i>Hippa emerita</i>) and the
Hermit Crabs. Among the Macrura we are acquainted with the same
earliest form principally in several Shrimps and Prawns, such as
<i>Crangon</i> (Du Cane), <i>Caridina</i> (Joly), <i>Hippolyte,
Pal&aelig;mon, Alpheus,</i> etc. Lastly, it is not improbable, that
the youngest brood of the Mantis-Shrimps (<i>Squilla</i>) is also
in the same case.</p>

<p>The most important peculiarities which distinguish this
Zo&euml;a-brood from the adult animal, are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The middle-body with its appendages, those five pairs of feet to
which these animals owe their name of Decapoda, is either entirely
wanting, or scarcely indicated; the abdomen and tail are destitute
of appendages, and the latter consists of a single piece. The
mandibles, as in the Insecta, have no palpi. The maxillipedes, of
which the third pair is often still wanting, are not yet brought
into the service of the mouth, but appear in the form of biramose
natatory feet. Branchi&aelig; are wanting, or where their first
rudiments may be detected as small verruciform prominences, these
are dense cell-masses, through which the blood does not yet flow,
and which therefore have nothing to do with respiration. An
interchange of the gases of the water and blood may occur all over
the thin-skinned surface of the body; but the lateral parts of the
carapace may unhesitatingly be indicated as the chief seat of
respiration. They consist, exactly as described by Leydig in the
<i>Daphni&aelig;,</i> of an outer and inner lamina, the space
between which is traversed by numerous transverse partitions
dilated at their ends; the spaces between these partitions are
penetrated by a more abundant flow of blood than occurs anywhere
else in the body of the Zo&euml;a. To this may be added that a
constant current of fresh water passes beneath the carapace in a
direction from behind forwards, maintained as in the adult animal,
by a foliaceous or linguiform appendage of the second pair of
maxill&aelig; (Fig. 18). The addition of fine coloured particles to
the water allows this current of water to be easily detected even
in small Zo&euml;&aelig;.</p>

<br>
<p>The Zo&euml;&aelig; of the Crabs (Fig. 17) are usually
distinguished by long, spiniform processes of the carapace. One of
these projects upwards from the middle of the back, a second
downwards from the forehead, and frequently there is a shorter one
on each side near the posterior inferior angles of the carapace.
All these processes are, however, wanting in Maia according to
Couch, and in <i>Eurynome</i> according to Kinahan; and in a third
species of the same group of the <i>Oxyrhynchi</i> (belonging or
nearly allied to the genus <i>Ach&aelig;us</i>) I also find only an
inconsiderable dorsal spine, whilst the forehead and sides are
unarmed. This is another example warning us to be cautious in
deductions from analogy. Nothing seemed more probable than to refer
back the beak-like formation of the forehead in the Oxyrhynchi to
the frontal process of the Zo&euml;a, and now it appears that the
young of the Oxyrhynchi are really quite destitute of any such
process. The following are more important peculiarities of the
Zo&euml;&aelig; of the Crabs, although less striking than these
processes of the carapace which, in combination with the large
eyes, often give them so singular an appearance:&mdash;the anterior
(inner) antenn&aelig; are simple, not jointed, and furnished at the
extremity with from two to three olfactory filaments; the posterior
(outer) antenn&aelig; frequently run out into a remarkably long
spine-like process (&ldquo;styliform process,&rdquo; Spence Bate),
and bear, on the outside, an appendage, which is sometimes very
minute (&ldquo;squamiform process&rdquo; of Spence Bate),
corresponding with the antennal scale of the Prawns,<a href=
"#3."><sup>3</sup></a> and the first rudiment of the future
flagellum is often already recognisable. Of natatory feet
(afterwards maxillipeds) only two pairs are present; the third
(not, as Spence Bate thinks, the first) is entirely wanting, or,
like the five following pairs of feet, present only as a minute
bud. The tail, of very variable form, always bears <i>three</i>
pairs of set&aelig; at its hinder margin. The Zo&euml;&aelig; of
the Crabs usually maintain themselves in the water in such a manner
that the dorsal spine stands upwards, the abdomen is bent forwards,
the inner branch of the natatory feet is directed forwards, and the
outer one outwards and upwards.</p>

Figs. 22 and 23 of unknown origin.</p>

<br>
<p>It is further to be remarked that the Zo&euml;&aelig; of the
Crabs, as also of the <i>Porcellan&aelig;,</i> of the Tatuira and
of the Shrimps and Prawns, are enveloped, on escaping from the egg,
by a membrane veiling the spinous processes of the carapace, the
set&aelig; of the feet, and the antenn&aelig;, and that they cast
this in a few hours. In <i>Ach&aelig;us</i> I have observed that
the tail of this earliest larval skin resembles that of the
larv&aelig; of Shrimps and Prawns, and the same appears to be the
case in <i>Maia</i> (see Bell, &lsquo;Brit. Stalk-eyed
Crust.&rsquo; p. 44). Widely as they seem to differ from them at
the first glance, the Zo&euml;&aelig; of the <i>
Porcellan&aelig;</i> (Fig. 24) approach those of the true Crabs
very closely. The antenn&aelig;, organs of the mouth, and natatory
feet, exhibit the same structure. But the tail bears <i>five</i>
pairs of set&aelig;, and the dorsal spine is wanting, whilst, on
the contrary, the frontal process and the lateral spines are of
extraordinary length, and directed straight forward and
backward.</p>

<br>
<p>The Zo&euml;a of the Tatuira (Fig. 25) also appears to differ
but little from those of the true Crabs, which it likewise
resembles in its mode of locomotion. The carapace possesses only a
short, broad frontal process; the posterior margin of the tail is
edged with numerous short set&aelig;.</p>

<p>The Zo&euml;a of the Hermit Crabs (Fig. 26) possesses the simple
inner antenn&aelig; of the Zo&euml;a of the true Crabs; the outer
antenn&aelig; bear upon the outside on a short stalk a lamella of
considerable size analogous to the scale of the antenn&aelig; of
the Prawns; on the inside, a short, spine-like process; and between
the two the flagellum, still short, but already furnished with two
apical set&aelig;. As in the Crabs, there are only two pairs of
well-developed natatory feet (maxillipedes), but the third pair is
also present in the form of a two-jointed stump of considerable
size, although still destitute of set&aelig;. The tail bears five
pairs of set&aelig;. The little animal usually holds itself
extended straight in the water, with the head directed
downwards.</p>

<p>This is also the position in which we usually see the
Zo&euml;&aelig; of the Shrimps and Prawns (Fig. 27), which agree in
their general appearance with those of the Hermit Crabs. Between
the large compound eyes there is in them a small median eye. The
inner antenn&aelig; bear, at the end of a basal joint sometimes of
considerable length, on the inside a plumose seta, which also
occurs in the Hermit Crabs, and on the outside a short terminal
joint with one or more olfactory filaments. The outer antenn&aelig;
exhibit a well-developed and sometimes distinctly articulated
scale, and within this usually a spiniform process; the flagellum
appears generally to be still wanting. The third pair of
maxillipedes seems to be always present, at least in the form of
considerable rudiments. The spatuliform caudal lamina bears from
five to six pairs of set&aelig; on its hinder margin.</p>

<br>
<p>The development of the Zo&euml;a-brood to the sexually mature
animal was traced by Spence Bate in <i>Carcinus m&aelig;nas.</i> He
proved that the metamorphosis is a perfectly gradual one, and that
no sharply separated stages of development, like the caterpillar
and pupa of the Lepidoptera, could be defined in it. Unfortunately
we possess only this single complete series of observations, and
its results cannot be regarded at once as universally applicable;
thus the young Hermit Crabs retain the general aspect and mode of
locomotion of Zo&euml;&aelig;, whilst the rudiments of the thoracic
and abdominal feet are growing, and then, when these come into
action, appear at once in a perfectly new form, which differs from
that of the adult animal chiefly by the complete symmetry of the
body and by the presence of four pairs of well-developed natatory
feet on the abdomen.<a href="#4."><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>The development of the Palinuridi&aelig; seems to be very
peculiar. Claus found in the ova of the Spiny Lobster
(<i>Palinurus</i>), embryos with a completely segmented body, but
wanting the appendages of the tail, abdomen, and last two segments
of the middle-body; they possess a single median and considerably
compound eye; the anterior antenn&aelig; are simple, the posterior
furnished with a small secondary branch; the mandibles have no
palpi; the maxillipedes of the third pair, like the two following
pairs of feet, are divided into two branches of nearly equal
length; whilst the last of the existing pairs of feet and the
second pair of maxillipedes bear only an inconsiderable secondary
branch. Coste, as is well known, asserts that he has bred young <i>
Phyllosomata</i> from the ova of this lobster&mdash;a statement
that requires further proof, especially as the more recent
investigations of Claus upon <i>Phyllosoma</i> by no means appear
to be in its favour.</p>

<p>The large compound eyes, which usually soon become moveable, and
sometimes stand upon long stalks even in the earliest period, as
well as the carapace, which covers the entire fore-body, indicate
at once that the position of the larv&aelig; hitherto considered,
notwithstanding all their differences, is under the Podophthalma.
But not a single characteristic of this section is retained by the
brood of some Prawns belonging to the genus <i>Pen&euml;us</i> or
in its vicinity. These quit the egg with an unsegmented ovate body,
a median frontal eye, and three pairs of natatory feet, of which
the anterior are simple, and the other two biramose&mdash;in fact,
in the larval form, so common among the lower Crustacea, to which
O. F. M&uuml;ller gave the name of <i>Nauplius.</i> No trace of a
carapace! no trace of the paired eyes! no trace of masticating
organs near the mouth which is overarched by a helmet-like
hood!</p>

<p>In the case of one of these species the intermediate forms which
lead from the Nauplius to the Prawn, have been discovered in a
nearly continuous series.</p>

<p>The youngest Nauplius (Fig. 28) is immediately followed by forms
in which a fold of skin runs across the back behind the third pair
of feet, and four pairs of stout processes (rudiments of new limbs)
sprout forth on the ventral surface. Within the third pair of feet,
powerful mandibles are developed.</p>

<p class="capt1">Fig. 28. Nauplius of a Prawn, magnified.<br>
<a name="Fig.29">Fig. 29.</a> Young Zo&euml;a of the same Prawn, magnified.</p>

<br>
<p>In a subsequent moult the new limbs (maxill&aelig;, and anterior
and intermediate maxillipedes) come into action, and in this way
the Nauplius becomes a Zo&euml;a (Fig. 29), agreeing perfectly with
the Zo&euml;a of the Crabs in the number of the appendages of the
body, although very different in form and mode of locomotion and
even in many particulars of internal structure. The chief organs of
motion are still the two anterior pairs of feet, which are slender
and furnished with long set&aelig;; the third pair of feet loses
its branches, and becomes converted into mandibles destitute of
palpi. The labrum acquires a spine directed forward and of
considerable size, which occurs in all the Zo&euml;&aelig; of
allied species. The biramose maxillipedes appear to assist but
slightly in locomotion. The forked tail reminds us rather of the
forms occurring in the lower Crustacea, especially the Copepoda,
than of the spatuliform caudal plate which characterises the
Zo&euml;&aelig; of <i>Alpheus, Pal&aelig;mon, Hippolyte,</i> and
other Prawns, of the Hermit Crabs, the Tatuira and the <i>
Porcellan&aelig;.</i> The heart possesses only one pair of
fissures, and has no muscles traversing its interior like
trabecul&aelig;, whilst in other Zo&euml;&aelig; two pairs of
fissures and an interior apparatus of trabecul&aelig; are always
distinctly recognisable.</p>

magnified.<br>
Fig. 31. <i>Mysis</i>-form of the same Prawn, magnified.</p>

<br>
<p>During this Zo&euml;al period the paired eyes, the segments of
the middle-body and abdomen, the posterior maxillipedes, the
lateral caudal appendages and the stump-like rudiments of the feet
of the middle-body are formed (Fig. 30). The caudal appendages
sprout forth like other limbs freely on the ventral surface, whilst
in other Prawns, the <i>Porcellan&aelig;,</i> etc., they are
produced in the interior of the spatuliform caudal plate.</p>

<p>As the feet of the middle-body come into action, simultaneously
with other profound changes, the Zo&euml;a passes into the <i>
Mysis-</i> or Schizopod-form (Fig. 31). The antenn&aelig; cease to
serve for locomotion, their place is taken by the thoracic feet,
furnished with long set&aelig;, and by the long abdomen which just
before was laboriously dragged along as a useless burden, but now,
with its powerful muscles, jerks the animal through the water in a
series of lively jumps. The anterior antenn&aelig; have lost their
long set&aelig;, and by the side of the last (fourth) joint,
endowed with olfactory filaments, there appears a second branch,
which is at first of a single joint. The previously
multi-articulate outer branch of the posterior antenn&aelig; has
become a simple lamella, the antennal scale of the Prawn; beside
this appears the stump-like rudiment of the flagellum, probably as
a new formation, the inner branch disappearing entirely. The five
new pairs of feet are biramose, the inner branch short and simple,
the outer one longer, annulated at the end, furnished with long
set&aelig;, and kept, as in <i>Mysis,</i> in constant whirling
motion. The heart acquires new fissures, and interior muscular
trabecul&aelig;.</p>

<p>During the <i>Mysis</i>-period, the auditory organs in the basal
joint of the anterior antenn&aelig; are formed; the inner branches
of the first three pairs of feet are developed into chel&aelig; and
the two hinder pairs into ambulatory feet; palpi sprout from the
mandibles, branchi&aelig; on the thorax, and natatory feet on the
abdomen. The spine on the labrum becomes reduced in size. In this
way the animal gradually approaches the Prawn-form, in which the
median eye has become indistinct, the spine of the labrum, and the
outer branches of the cheliferous and ambulatory feet have been
lost, the mandibular palpi and the abdominal feet have acquired
distinct joints and set&aelig;, and the branchi&aelig; come into
action.</p>

<p>In another Prawn, the various larval states of which may be
easily recognised as belonging to the same series by the presence
of a dark-yellow, sharply-defined spot surrounding the median eye,
the youngest Zo&euml;a (Fig. 32), probably produced from the
Nauplius, agrees in all essential particulars with the species just
described; its further development is, however, very different,
especially in that neither the feet of the middle, nor those of the
hind-body are formed simultaneously, and that a stage of
development comparable to Mysis in the number and structure of the
limbs does not occur.</p>

<br>
<p>Traces of the outer maxillipedes make their appearance betimes.
Then feet appear upon four segments of the middle-body, and these
are biramose on the three anterior segments, and simple, the inner
branch being deficient, on the fourth segment. On the inner
branches the chel&aelig; are developed; the outer branches are lost
before an inner branch has made its appearance on the fourth
segment (Fig. 32). The latter again becomes destitute of
appendages, so that in this case at an early period four, and at a
later only three, segments of the middle-body bear limbs. The fifth
segment is still entirely wanting, whilst all the abdominal
segments have also acquired limbs, and this one after the other,
from before backwards. The adult animal, as shown by the three
pairs of chel&aelig;, will certainly be very nearly allied to the
preceding species.<a href="#5."><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>The youngest larva of the Schizopod genus Euphausia observed by
Claus, stands very near the youngest Zo&euml;a of our Prawns; but
whilst its anterior antenn&aelig; are already biramose, and it
therefore appears to be more advanced, it still wants the middle
maxillipedes. In it also Claus found the heart furnished with only
a single pair of fissures. Do not Nauplius-like states in this case
also precede the Zo&euml;a?</p>

<p>The developmental history of <i>Mysis,</i> the near relationship
of which with the Shrimps and Prawns has recently again been
generally recognised, has been described in detail by Van Beneden.
So far as I have tested them I can only confirm his statements. The
development of the embryo commences with the formation of the tail!
This makes its appearance as a simple lobe, the dorsal surface of
which is turned towards and closely applied to that of the embryo.
(The young of other Stalk-eyed Crustacea are, as is well known,
bent in the egg in such a manner that the ventral surfaces of the
anterior and posterior halves of the body are turned towards each
other,&mdash;in these, therefore, the dorsal, and in Mysis the
ventral surface appears convex.) The tail soon acquires the furcate
form with which we made acquaintance in the last Prawn-Zo&euml;a
described. Then two pairs of thick ensiform appendages make their
appearance at the opposite end of the body, and behind these a pair
of tubercles which are easily overlooked. These are the
antenn&aelig; and mandibles. The egg-membrane now bursts, before
any internal organ, or even any tissue, except the cells of the
cutaneous layer, is formed. The young animal might be called a
Nauplius; but essentially there is nothing but a rough copy of a
Nauplius-skin, almost like a new egg-membrane, within which the <i>
Mysis</i> is developed. The ten pairs of appendages of the fore-
(maxill&aelig;, maxillipedes) and middle-body make their appearance
simultaneously, as do the five pairs of abdominal feet at a later
period. Soon after the young <i>Mysis</i> casts the
Nauplius-envelope it quits the brood-pouch of the mother.<a href=
"#6."><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>For some time, owing to an undue importance being ascribed to
the want of a particular branchial cavity, <i>Mysis, Leucifer,</i>
and <i>Phyllosoma</i> were referred to the Stomapoda, which are now
again limited, as originally by Latreille, to the Mantis-shrimps
(<i>Squilla</i>), the Glass-shrimps (<i>Erichthus</i>) and their
nearest allies. Of the developmental history of these we have
hitherto been acquainted with only isolated fragments. The tracing
of the development in the egg is rendered difficult by the
circumstance, that the Mantis-shrimps do not, like the Decapoda,
carry their spawn about with them, but deposit it in the
subterranean passages inhabited by them in the form of thin, round,
yellow plates. The spawn is consequently exceedingly difficult to
procure, and unfortunately it becomes spoilt in a day when it is
removed from its natural hatching place, whilst on the contrary the
progress of development may be followed for weeks together in the
eggs of a single Crab kept in confinement. The eggs of <i>
Squilla,</i> like those removed from the body of the Crab, die
because they are deprived of the rapid stream of fresh water which
the mother drives through her hole for the purpose of her own
respiration.</p>

<p>The accompanying representation of the embryo of <i>Squilla</i>
shows that it possesses a long, segmented abdomen without
appendages, a bilobate tail, six pairs of limbs, and a short heart;
the latter only pulsates weakly and slowly. If it acquires more
limbs before exclusion, the youngest larva must stand on the same
level as the youngest larva of <i>Euphausia</i> observed by
Claus.</p>

<br>
<p>Of the two larval forms at present known which are with
certainty to be ascribed, if not to <i>Squilla,</i> at least to a
Stomapod, I pass over the younger one<a href="#7."><sup>7</sup></a>
as its limbs cannot be positively interpreted, and will only
mention that in it the last three abdominal segments are still
destitute of appendages. The older larva (Fig. 35), which resembles
the mature Squilla especially in the structure of the great
raptorial feet and of the preceding pair, still wants the six pairs
of feet following the raptorial feet. The corresponding
body-segments are already well developed, an unpaired eye is still
present, the anterior antenn&aelig; are already biramose, whilst
the flagellum is wanting in the posterior, and the mandibles are
destitute of palpi; the four anterior abdominal segments bear
biramose natatory feet, without branchi&aelig;; the fifth abdominal
segment has no appendages, and this is also the case with the tail,
which still appears as a simple lamina, fringed on the hinder
margin with numerous short teeth. It is evident that the larva
stands essentially in the grade of Zo&euml;a.</p>

<a name="2.">2.</a> Bell (&lsquo;Brit. Stalk-eyed Crust.&rsquo; p.
xlv) considers himself justified in &ldquo;eliminating&rdquo;
Thompson&rsquo;s observation at once, because he could only have
examined ovigerous females preserved in alcohol. But any one who
had paid so much attention as Thompson to the development of these
animals, must have been well able to decide with certainty upon
eggs, if not too far from maturity or badly preserved, whether a
Zo&euml;a would be produced from them. Moreover, the mode of life
of the Land-Crabs is in favour of Thompson. &ldquo;Once in the
year,&rdquo; says Troschel&rsquo;s &lsquo;Handbuch der
Zoologie,&rsquo; &ldquo;they migrate in great crowds to the sea in
order to deposit their eggs, and afterwards return much exhausted
towards their dwelling places, which are reached only by a
few.&rdquo; For what purpose would be these destructive migrations
in species whose young quit the egg and the mother as terrestrial
animals?<br>
<a name="3.">3.</a> In a memoir on the metamorphoses of the
Porcellan&aelig; I have erroneously described this appendage as the
&ldquo;flagellum.&rdquo;<br>
<a name="4.">4.</a> <i>Glaucotho&euml; Peronii,</i> M.-Edw., may
be a young and still symmetrical <i>Pagurus</i> of this kind.<br>
<a name="5.">5.</a> The oldest observed larv&aelig; (see Fig. 33)
are characterised by the extraordinary length of the flagella of
the outer antenn&aelig;, and in this respect resemble the larva of
<i>Sergestes</i> found by Claus near Messina (Zeitschr. f&uuml;r
Wiss. Zool. Bd. xiii. Taf. 27, Fig. 14). This unusual length of the
antenn&aelig; leads to the supposition that they belong to our
commonest Prawn, which is very frequently eaten, and is most nearly
allied to <i>Pen&euml;us setiferus</i> of Florida. Claus&rsquo;s
<i>Acanthosoma</i> (<i>l. c.</i> Fig. 13) is like the younger <i>
Mysis</i>-form of the larva figured by me in the &lsquo;Archiv
f&uuml;r Naturgeschichte,&rsquo; 1836, Taf. 2, Fig. 18, and which I
am inclined to refer to <i>Sicyonia carinata.</i><br>
<a name="6.">6.</a> Van Beneden, who regards the eye-peduncles as
limbs, cannot however avoid remarking upon <i>Mysis</i>: &ldquo;Ce
p&eacute;dicule n&rsquo;appara&icirc;t aucunement comme les autres
appendices, et para&icirc;t avoir une autre valeur
morphologique.&rdquo;<br>
