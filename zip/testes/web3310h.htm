<h1>
Micah
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> The word of Yahweh that
came to Micah the Morashtite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah,
kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> Hear, you peoples, all
of you.
<dd>Listen, O earth, and all that is therein:
<dt>and let the Lord Yahweh be witness against you,
<dd>the Lord from his holy temple.
<dt> <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> For, behold, Yahweh
comes forth out of his place,
<dd>and will come down and tread on the high places of the earth.
<dt> <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> The mountains melt
under him,
<dd>and the valleys split apart,
<dd>like wax before the fire,
<dd>like waters that are poured down a steep place.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> &quot;All this is for
the disobedience of Jacob,
<dd>and for the sins of the house of Israel.
<dt>What is the disobedience of Jacob?
<dd>Isn't it Samaria?
<dt>And what are the high places of Judah?
<dd>Aren't they Jerusalem?
<dt> <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> Therefore I will make
Samaria like a rubble heap of the field,
<dd>like places for planting vineyards;
<dt>and I will pour down its stones into the valley,
<dd>and I will uncover its foundations.
<dt> <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> All her idols will be
beaten to pieces,
<dd>and all her temple gifts will be burned with fire,
<dd>and all her images I will destroy;
<dt>for of the hire of a prostitute has she gathered them,
<dd>and to the hire of a prostitute shall they return.&quot;
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> For this I will lament
and wail;
<dd>I will go stripped and naked;
<dd>I will howl like the jackals,
<dd>and moan like the daughters of owls.
<dt> <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> For her wounds are
incurable;
<dd>for it has come even to Judah.
<dt>It reaches to the gate of my people,
<dd>even to Jerusalem.
<dt> <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> Don't tell it in Gath.
<dd>Don't weep at all.
<dd>At <a href="#N1">Beth Ophrah</a> I have rolled myself in the dust.
<dt> <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> Pass on, inhabitant
of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame.
<dd>The inhabitant of Zaanan won't come out.
<dd>The wailing of Beth Ezel will take from you his protection.
<dt> <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> For the inhabitant of
Maroth waits anxiously for good,
<dd>because evil has come down from Yahweh to the gate of Jerusalem.
<dt> <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> Harness the chariot
to the swift steed, inhabitant of Lachish.
<dd>She was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion;
<dd>For the transgressions of Israel were found in you.
<dt> <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> Therefore you will
give a parting gift to Moresheth Gath.
<dd>The houses of Achzib will be a deceitful thing to the kings of Israel.
<dt> <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> I will yet bring to
you, inhabitant of Mareshah.
<dd>He who is the glory of Israel will come to Adullam.
<dt> <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> Shave your heads,
<dd>and cut off your hair for the children of your delight.
<dt>Enlarge your baldness like the vulture;
<dd>for they have gone into captivity from you!
<dt>
</dl>
<dl> <dt><a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> Woe to those who
devise iniquity
<dd>and work evil on their beds!
<dt>When the morning is light, they practice it,
<dd>because it is in the power of their hand.
<dt> <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> They covet fields, and
seize them;
<dd>and houses, and take them away:
<dd>and they oppress a man and his house,
<dd>even a man and his heritage.
<dt> <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> Therefore thus says
Yahweh:
<dt>&quot;Behold, I am planning against these people a disaster,
<dd>from which you will not remove your necks,
<dd>neither will you walk haughtily;
<dd>for it is an evil time.
<dt> <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> In that day they will
take up a parable against you,
<dd>and lament with a doleful lamentation, saying,
<dd>'We are utterly ruined!
<dd>My people's possession is divided up.
<dd>Indeed he takes it from me and assigns our fields to traitors!'&quot;
<dt> <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> Therefore you will
have no one who divides the land by lot in the assembly of Yahweh.
<dt> <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> &quot;Don't
prophesy!&quot;
<dd>They prophesy.
<dt>&quot;Don't prophesy about these things.
<dd>Disgrace won't overtake us.&quot;
<dt> <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> Shall it be said, O
house of Jacob:
<dd>&quot;Is the Spirit of Yahweh angry?
<dd>Are these his doings?
<dd>Don't my words do good to him who walks blamelessly?&quot;
<dt> <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> But lately my people
have risen up as an enemy.
<dd>You strip the robe and clothing from those who pass by without a care,
returning from battle.
<dt> <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> You drive the women of
my people out from their pleasant houses;
<dd>from their young children you take away my blessing forever.
<dt> <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> Arise, and depart!
<dd>For this is not your resting place,
<dd>because of uncleanness that destroys,
<dd>even with a grievous destruction.
<dt> <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> If a man walking in a
spirit of falsehood lies:
<dd>&quot;I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink;&quot;
<dd>he would be the prophet of this people.
<dt> <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> I will surely
assemble, Jacob, all of you;
<dd>I will surely gather the remnant of Israel;
<dt>I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah,
<dd>as a flock in the midst of their pasture;
<dd>they will swarm with people.
<dt> <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> He who breaks open
the way goes up before them.
<dd>They break through the gate, and go out.
<dd>And their king passes on before them,
<dd>with Yahweh at their head.
</dl>
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> I said,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Please listen, you heads of Jacob,
<dd>and rulers of the house of Israel:
<dd>Isn't it for you to know justice?
<dt> <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> You who hate the good,
<dd>and love the evil;
<dd>who tear off their skin,
<dd>and their flesh from off their bones;
<dd> <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> who also eat the flesh
of my people,
<dd>and flay their skin from off them,
<dd>and break their bones,
<dd>and chop them in pieces, as for the pot,
<dd>and as flesh within the caldron.
<dt> <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> Then they will cry to
Yahweh,
<dd>but he will not answer them.
<dt>Yes, he will hide his face from them at that time,
<dd>because they made their deeds evil.&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> Thus says Yahweh
concerning the prophets who lead my people astray; for those who feed
their teeth, they proclaim, &quot;Peace!&quot; and whoever doesn't provide
for their mouths, they prepare war against him:
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> &quot;Therefore night
is over you, with no vision,
<dd>and it is dark to you, that you may not divine;
<dd>and the sun will go down on the prophets,
<dd>and the day will be black over them.
<dt> <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> The seers shall be
disappointed,
<dd>and the diviners confounded.
<dt>Yes, they shall all cover their lips;
<dd>for there is no answer from God.&quot;
<dt> <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> But as for me, I am
full of power by the Spirit of Yahweh,
<dd>and of judgment, and of might,
<dd>to declare to Jacob his disobedience,
<dd>and to Israel his sin.
<dt> <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> Please listen to this,
you heads of the house of Jacob,
<dd>and rulers of the house of Israel,
<dd>who abhor justice,
<dd>and pervert all equity.
<dt> <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> They build up Zion
with blood,
<dd>and Jerusalem with iniquity.
<dt> <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> Her leaders judge for
bribes,
<dd>and her priests teach for a price,
<dd>and her prophets of it tell fortunes for money:
<dt>yet they lean on Yahweh, and say,
<dd>&quot;Isn't Yahweh in the midst of us?
<dd>No disaster will come on us.&quot;
<dt> <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> Therefore Zion for
your sake will be plowed like a field,
<dd>and Jerusalem will become heaps of rubble,
<dd>and the mountain of the temple like the high places of a forest.
<dt>
</dl>
<dl> <dt><a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> But in the latter days,
<dd>it will happen that the mountain of Yahweh's temple will be
established on the top of the mountains,
<dd>and it will be exalted above the hills;
<dd>and peoples will stream to it.
<dt> <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> Many nations will go
and say,
<dd>&quot;Come, and let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh,
<dd>and to the house of the God of Jacob;
<dd>and he will teach us of his ways,
<dd>and we will walk in his paths.&quot;
<dt>For out of Zion will go forth the law,
<dd>and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem;
<dt> <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> and he will judge
between many peoples,
<dd>and will decide concerning strong nations afar off.
<dd>They will beat their swords into plowshares,
<dd>and their spears into pruning hooks.
<dt>Nation will not lift up sword against nation,
<dd>neither will they learn war any more.
<dt> <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> But they will sit
every man under his vine and under his fig tree;
<dd>and no one will make them afraid:
<dd>For the mouth of Yahweh of Armies has spoken.  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> Indeed all the nations may walk in
the name of their gods;
<dd>but we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever and ever.
<dt> <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> &quot;In that
day,&quot; says Yahweh,
<dd>&quot;I will assemble that which is lame,
<dd>and I will gather that which is driven away,
<dd>and that which I have afflicted;
<dd> <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> and I will make that
which was lame a remnant,
<dd>and that which was cast far off a strong nation:
<dd>and Yahweh will reign over them on Mount Zion from then on, even
forever.&quot;
<dt> <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> You, tower of the
flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion,
<dd>to you it will come,
<dd>yes, the former dominion will come,
<dd>the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.
<dt> <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> Now why do you cry out
aloud?
<dd>Is there no king in you?
<dd>Has your counselor perished,
<dd>that pains have taken hold of you as of a woman in travail?
<dt> <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> Be in pain, and labor
to bring forth, daughter of Zion,
<dd>like a woman in travail;
<dd>for now you will go forth out of the city,
<dd>and will dwell in the field,
<dd>and will come even to Babylon.
<dt>There you will be rescued.
<dd>There Yahweh will redeem you from the hand of your enemies.
<dt> <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> Now many nations have
assembled against you, that say,
<dd>&quot;Let her be defiled,
<dd>and let our eye gloat over Zion.&quot;
<dt> <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> But they don't know
the thoughts of Yahweh,
<dd>neither do they understand his counsel;
<dd>for he has gathered them like the sheaves to the threshing floor.
<dt> <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> Arise and thresh,
daughter of Zion;
<dd>for I will make your horn iron,
<dd>and I will make your hoofs brass;
<dt>and you will beat in pieces many peoples:
<dt>and I will devote their gain to Yahweh,
<dd>and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.
<dt>
</dl>
<dl> <dt><a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> Now you shall gather
yourself in troops,
<dd>daughter of troops.
<dt>He has laid siege against us.
<dd>They will strike the judge of Israel with a rod on the cheek.
<dt> <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> But you, Bethlehem
Ephrathah,
<dd>being small among the clans of Judah,
<dd>out of you one will come forth to me that is to be ruler in Israel;
<dd>whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.
<dt> <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> Therefore he will
abandon them until the time that she who is in labor gives birth.
<dd>Then the rest of his brothers will return to the children of Israel.
<dt> <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> He shall stand, and
shall shepherd in the strength of Yahweh,
<dd>in the majesty of the name of Yahweh his God:
<dd>and they will live, for then he will be great to the ends of the earth.
<dt> <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> He will be our peace
when Assyria invades our land,
<dd>and when he marches through our fortresses,
<dd>then we will raise against him seven shepherds,
<dd>and eight leaders of men.
<dt> <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> They will rule the
land of Assyria with the sword,
<dd>and the land of Nimrod in its gates.
<dt>He will deliver us from the Assyrian,
<dd>when he invades our land,
<dd>and when he marches within our border.
<dt> <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> The remnant of Jacob
will be in the midst of many peoples,
<dd>like dew from Yahweh,
<dd>like showers on the grass,
<dd>that don't wait for man,
<dd>nor wait for the sons of men.
<dt> <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> The remnant of Jacob
will be among the nations,
<dd>in the midst of many peoples,
<dd>like a lion among the animals of the forest,
<dd>like a young lion among the flocks of sheep;
<dd>who, if he goes through, treads down and tears in pieces,
<dd>and there is no one to deliver.
<dt> <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> Let your hand be
lifted up above your adversaries,
<dd>and let all of your enemies be cut off.
<dt> <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> &quot;It will happen
in that day,&quot; says Yahweh,
<dd>&quot;That I will cut off your horses out of the midst of you,
<dd>and will destroy your chariots.
<dt> <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> I will cut off the
cities of your land,
<dd>and will tear down all your strongholds.
<dt> <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> I will destroy
witchcraft from your hand;
<dd>and you shall have no soothsayers.
<dt> <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> I will cut off your
engraved images and your pillars out of your midst;
<dd>and you shall no more worship the work of your hands.
<dt> <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> I will uproot your
Asherim out of your midst;
<dd>and I will destroy your cities.
<dt> <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> I will execute
vengeance in anger,
<dd>and wrath on the nations that didn't listen.&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> Listen now to what
Yahweh says:
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Arise, plead your case before the mountains,
<dd>and let the hills hear what you have to say.
<dt> <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> Hear, you mountains,
Yahweh's controversy,
<dd>and you enduring foundations of the earth;
<dd>for Yahweh has a controversy with his people,
<dd>and he will contend with Israel.
<dt> <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> My people, what have I
done to you?
<dd>How have I burdened you?
<dd>Answer me!
<dt> <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> For I brought you up
out of the land of Egypt,
<dd>and redeemed you out of the house of bondage.
<dd>I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
<dt> <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> My people, remember
now what Balak king of Moab devised,
<dd>and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim to Gilgal,
<dd>that you may know the righteous acts of Yahweh.&quot;
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> How shall I come
before Yahweh,
<dd>and bow myself before the exalted God?
<dt>Shall I come before him with burnt offerings,
<dd>with calves a year old?
<dt> <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> Will Yahweh be pleased
with thousands of rams?
<dd>With tens of thousands of rivers of oil?
<dt>Shall I give my firstborn for my disobedience?
<dd>The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
<dt> <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> He has shown you, O
man, what is good.
<dd>What does Yahweh require of you, but to act justly,
<dd>to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> Yahweh's voice calls
to the city,
<dd>and wisdom sees your name:
<dt>&quot;Listen to the rod,
<dd>and he who appointed it.
<dt> <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> Are there yet
treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked,
<dd>and a <a href="#N2">short ephah</a> that is accursed?
<dt> <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> Shall I be pure with
dishonest scales,
<dd>and with a bag of deceitful weights?
<dt> <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> Her rich men are full
of violence,
<dd>her inhabitants speak lies,
<dd>and their tongue is deceitful in their speech.
<dt> <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> Therefore I also have
struck you with a grievous wound.
<dd>I have made you desolate because of your sins.
<dt> <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> You shall eat, but
not be satisfied.
<dd>Your humiliation will be in your midst.
<dd>You will store up, but not save;
<dd>and that which you save I will give up to the sword.
<dt> <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> You will sow, but
won't reap.
<dd>You will tread the olives, but won't anoint yourself with oil;
<dd>and crush grapes, but won't drink the wine.
<dt> <a name="C6V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:16</font></a> For the statutes of
Omri are kept,
<dd>and all the works of the house of Ahab.
<dd>You walk in their counsels,
<dd>that I may make you a ruin,
<dd>and her inhabitants a hissing;
<dd>And you will bear the reproach of my people.&quot;
<dt>
<dt>
</dl>
<dl> <dt><a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> Misery is mine!
<dd>Indeed, I am like one who gathers the summer fruits, as gleanings of
the vineyard:
<dd>There is no cluster of grapes to eat.
<dd>My soul desires to eat the early fig.
<dt> <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> The godly man has
perished out of the earth,
<dd>and there is no one upright among men.
<dd>They all lie in wait for blood;
<dd>every man hunts his brother with a net.
<dt> <a name="C7V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:3</font></a> Their hands are on
that which is evil to do it diligently.
<dd>The ruler and judge ask for a bribe;
<dd>and the powerful man dictates the evil desire of his soul.
<dd>Thus they conspire together.
<dt> <a name="C7V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:4</font></a> The best of them is
like a brier.
<dd>The most upright is worse than a thorn hedge.
<dt>The day of your watchmen,
<dd>even your visitation, has come;

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people<br>

that have responded.</p>

<p>As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list<br>
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.<br>
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.</p>

<p>In answer to various questions we have received on this:</p>

<p>We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally<br>
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>

below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
