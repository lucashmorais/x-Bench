# Mozmill Tests #

Mozmill tests are written in JavaScript. They can be run using the Mozmill
command line client. Once you have Mozmill installed, you can contribute by
running the tests, raising any issues you find, and writing new tests!

See the 'Mozmill' page on MDN for instructions on installing and running
